The portrait, after Sir William Richmond, R.A., was done about\\nthe time when most of the Essays were written--and that was not\\nyesterday.\\nCHAPTER I: ADVENTURES AMONG BOOKS\\nI\\nIn an age of reminiscences, is there room for the confessions of a\\nveteran, who remembers a great deal about books and very little about\\npeople? I have often wondered that a _Biographia Literaria_ has so\\nseldom been attempted--a biography or autobiography of a man in his\\nrelations with other minds. Coleridge, to be sure, gave this name to a\\nwork of his, but he wandered from his apparent purpose into a world of\\nalien disquisitions. The following pages are frankly bookish, and to the\\nbookish only do they appeal. The habit of reading has been praised as a\\nvirtue, and has been denounced as a vice. In no case, if we except the\\nperpetual study of newspapers (which cannot fairly be called reading), is\\nthe vice, or the virtue, common. It is more innocent than opium-eating,\\nthough, like opium-eating, it unlocks to us artificial paradises. I try\\nto say what I have found in books, what distractions from the world, what\\nteaching (not much), and what consolations.\\nIn beginning an _autobiographia literaria_, an account of how, and in\\nwhat order, books have appealed to a mind, which books have ever above\\nall things delighted, the author must pray to be pardoned for the sin of\\negotism. There is no other mind, naturally, of which the author knows so\\nmuch as of his own. _On n\\'a que soi_, as the poor girl says in one of M.\\nPaul Bourget\\'s novels. In literature, as in love, one can only speak for\\nhimself. This author did not, like Fulke Greville, retire into the\\nconvent of literature from the strife of the world, rather he was born to\\nbe, from the first, a dweller in the cloister of a library. Among the\\npoems which I remember best out of early boyhood is Lucy Ashton\\'s song,\\nin the \"Bride of Lammermoor\":--\\n \"Look not thou on beauty\\'s charming,\\n Sit thou still when kings are arming,\\n Taste not when the wine-cup glistens,\\n Speak not when the people listens,\\n Stop thine ear against the singer,\\n From the red gold keep thy finger,\\n Vacant heart, and hand, and eye,\\n Easy live and quiet die.\"\\nThe rhymes, unlearned, clung to my memory; they would sing themselves to\\nme on the way to school, or cricket-field, and, about the age of ten,\\nprobably without quite understanding them, I had chosen them for a kind\\nof motto in life, a tune to murmur along the _fallentis semita vitae_.\\nThis seems a queer idea for a small boy, but it must be confessed.\\n\"It takes all sorts to make a world,\" some are soldiers from the cradle,\\nsome merchants, some orators; nothing but a love of books was the gift\\ngiven to me by the fairies. It was probably derived from forebears on\\nboth sides of my family, one a great reader, the other a considerable\\ncollector of books which remained with us and were all tried, persevered\\nwith, or abandoned in turn, by a student who has not blanched before the\\n_Epigoniad_.\\nAbout the age of four I learned to read by a simple process. I had heard\\nthe elegy of Cock Robin till I knew it by rote, and I picked out the\\nletters and words which compose that classic till I could read it for\\nmyself. Earlier than that, \"Robinson Crusoe\" had been read aloud to me,\\nin an abbreviated form, no doubt. I remember the pictures of Robinson\\nfinding the footstep in the sand, and a dance of cannibals, and the\\nparrot. But, somehow, I have never read \"Robinson\" since: it is a\\npleasure to come.\\nThe first books which vividly impressed me were, naturally, fairy tales,\\nand chap-books about Robert Bruce, William Wallace, and Rob Roy. At that\\ntime these little tracts could be bought for a penny apiece. I can still\\nsee Bruce in full armour, and Wallace in a kilt, discoursing across a\\nburn, and Rob Roy slipping from the soldier\\'s horse into the stream. They\\ndid not then awaken a precocious patriotism; a boy of five is more at\\nhome in Fairyland than in his own country. The sudden appearance of the\\nWhite Cat as a queen after her head was cut off, the fiendish malice of\\nthe Yellow Dwarf, the strange cake of crocodile eggs and millet seed\\nwhich the mother of the Princess Frutilla made for the Fairy of the\\nDesert--these things, all fresh and astonishing, but certainly to be\\ncredited, are my first memories of romance. One story of a White\\nSerpent, with a woodcut of that mysterious reptile, I neglected to\\nsecure, probably for want of a penny, and I have regretted it ever since.\\nOne never sees those chap books now. \"The White Serpent,\" in spite of\\nall research, remains _introuvable_. It was a lost chance, and Fortune\\ndoes not forgive. Nobody ever interfered with these, or indeed with any\\nother studies of ours at that time, as long as they were not prosecuted\\non Sundays. \"The fightingest parts of the Bible,\" and the Apocrypha, and\\nstories like that of the Witch of Endor, were sabbatical literature, read\\nin a huge old illustrated Bible. How I advanced from the fairy tales to\\nShakespeare, what stages there were on the way--for there must have been\\nstages--is a thing that memory cannot recover. A nursery legend tells\\nthat I was wont to arrange six open books on six chairs, and go from one\\nto the others, perusing them by turns. No doubt this was what people\\ncall \"desultory reading,\" but I did not hear the criticism till later,\\nand then too often for my comfort. Memory holds a picture, more vivid\\nthan most, of a small boy reading the \"Midsummer Night\\'s Dream\" by\\nfirelight, in a room where candles were lit, and some one touched the\\npiano, and a young man and a girl were playing chess. The Shakespeare\\nwas a volume of Kenny Meadows\\' edition; there are fairies in it, and the\\nfairies seemed to come out of Shakespeare\\'s dream into the music and the\\nfirelight. At that moment I think that I was happy; it seemed an\\nenchanted glimpse of eternity in Paradise; nothing resembling it remains\\nwith me, out of all the years.\\nWe went from the border to the south of England, when the number of my\\nyears was six, and in England we found another paradise, a circulating\\nlibrary with brown, greasy, ill-printed, odd volumes of Shakespeare and\\nof the \"Arabian Nights.\" How their stained pages come before the eyes\\nagain--the pleasure and the puzzle of them! What did the lady in the\\nGeni\\'s glass box want with the Merchants? what meant all these\\nconversations between the Fat Knight and _Ford_, in the \"Merry Wives\"? It\\nwas delightful, but in parts it was difficult. Fragments of \"The\\nTempest,\" and of other plays, remain stranded in my memory from these\\nreadings: _Ferdinand_ and _Miranda_ at chess, _Cleopatra_ cuffing the\\nmessenger, the asp in the basket of figs, the _Friar_ and the\\n_Apothecary_, _Troilus_ on the Ilian walls, a vision of _Cassandra_ in\\nwhite muslin with her hair down. People forbid children to read this or\\nthat. I am sure they need not, and that even in our infancy the\\nmagician, Shakespeare, brings us nothing worse than a world of beautiful\\nvisions, half realised. In the Egyptian wizard\\'s little pool of ink,\\nonly the pure can see the visions, and in Shakespeare\\'s magic mirror\\nchildren see only what is pure. Among other books of that time I only\\nrecall a kind of Sunday novel, \"Naomi; or, The Last Days of Jerusalem.\"\\nWho, indeed, could forget the battering-rams, and the man who cried on\\nthe battlements, \"Woe, woe to myself and to Jerusalem!\" I seem to hear\\nhim again when boys break the hum of London with yells of the latest\\n\"disaster.\"\\nWe left England in a year, went back to Scotland, and awoke, as it were,\\nto know the glories of our birth. We lived in Scott\\'s country, within\\nfour miles of Abbotsford, and, so far, we had heard nothing of it. I\\nremember going with one of the maids into the cottage of a kinsman of\\nhers, a carpenter; a delightful place, where there was sawdust, where our\\nfirst fishing-rods were fashioned. Rummaging among the books, of course,\\nI found some cheap periodical with verses in it. The lines began--\\n \"The Baron of Smaylhome rose with day,\\n He spurred his courser on,\\n Without stop or stay, down the rocky way\\n That leads to Brotherstone.\"\\nA rustic tea-table was spread for us, with scones and honey, not to be\\nneglected. But they _were_ neglected till we had learned how--\\n \"The sable score of fingers four\\n Remains on that board impressed,\\n And for evermore that lady wore\\n A covering on her wrist.\"\\nWe did not know nor ask the poet\\'s name. Children, probably, say very\\nlittle about what is in their minds; but that unhappy knight, Sir Richard\\nof Coldinghame, and the Priest, with his chamber in the east, and the\\nmoody Baron, and the Lady, have dwelt in our mind ever since, and hardly\\nneed to be revived by looking at \"The Eve of St. John.\"\\nSoon after that we were told about Sir Walter, how great he was, how\\ngood, how, like Napoleon, his evil destiny found him at last, and he wore\\nhis heart away for honour\\'s sake. And we were given the \"Lay,\" and \"The\\nLady of the Lake.\" It was my father who first read \"Tam o\\' Shanter\" to\\nme, for which I confess I did not care at that time, preferring to take\\nwitches and bogies with great seriousness. It seemed as if Burns were\\ntrifling with a noble subject. But it was in a summer sunset, beside a\\nwindow looking out on Ettrick and the hill of the Three Brethren\\'s Cairn,\\nthat I first read, with the dearest of all friends, how--\\n \"The stag at eve had drunk his fill\\n Where danced the moon on Monan\\'s rill,\\n And deep his midnight lair had made\\n In lone Glenartney\\'s hazel shade.\"\\nThen opened the gates of romance, and with Fitz-James we drove the chase,\\ntill--\\n \"Few were the stragglers, following far,\\n That reached the lake of Vennachar,\\n And when the Brig of Turk was won,\\n The foremost horseman rode alone.\"\\nFrom that time, for months, there was usually a little volume of Scott in\\none\\'s pocket, in company with the miscellaneous collection of a boy\\'s\\ntreasures. Scott certainly took his fairy folk seriously, and the Mauth\\nDog was rather a disagreeable companion to a small boy in wakeful hours.\\n{1} After this kind of introduction to Sir Walter, after learning one\\'s\\nfirst lessons in history from the \"Tales of a Grandfather,\" nobody, one\\nhopes, can criticise him in cold blood, or after the manner of Mr. Leslie\\nStephen, who is not sentimental. Scott is not an author like another,\\nbut our earliest known friend in letters; for, of course, we did not ask\\nwho Shakespeare was, nor inquire about the private history of Madame\\nd\\'Aulnoy. Scott peopled for us the rivers and burnsides with his\\nreivers; the Fairy Queen came out of Eildon Hill and haunted Carterhaugh;\\nat Newark Tower we saw \"the embattled portal arch\"--\\n \"Whose ponderous grate and massy bar\\n Had oft rolled back the tide of war,\"--\\njust as, at Foulshiels, on Yarrow, we beheld the very roofless cottage\\nwhence Mungo Park went forth to trace the waters of the Niger, and at\\nOakwood the tower of the Wizard Michael Scott.\\nProbably the first novel I ever read was read at Elgin, and the story was\\n\"Jane Eyre.\" This tale was a creepy one for a boy of nine, and Rochester\\nwas a mystery, St. John a bore. But the lonely little girl in her\\ndespair, when something came into the room, and her days of starvation at\\nschool, and the terrible first Mrs. Rochester, were not to be forgotten.\\nThey abide in one\\'s recollection with a Red Indian\\'s ghost, who carried a\\nrusty ruined gun, and whose acquaintance was made at the same time.\\nI fancy I was rather an industrious little boy, and that I had minded my\\nlessons, and satisfied my teachers--I know I was reading Pinnock\\'s\\n\"History of Rome\" for pleasure--till \"the wicked day of destiny\" came,\\nand I felt a \"call,\" and underwent a process which may be described as\\nthe opposite of \"conversion.\" The \"call\" came from Dickens. \"Pickwick\"\\nwas brought into the house. From that hour it was all over, for five or\\nsix years, with anything like industry and lesson-books. I read\\n\"Pickwick\" in convulsions of mirth. I dropped Pinnock\\'s \"Rome\" for good.\\nI neglected everything printed in Latin, in fact everything that one was\\nunderstood to prepare for one\\'s classes in the school whither I was now\\nsent, in Edinburgh. For there, living a rather lonely small boy in the\\nhouse of an aged relation, I found the Waverley Novels. The rest is\\ntransport. A conscientious tutor dragged me through the Latin grammar,\\nand a constitutional dislike to being beaten on the hands with a leather\\nstrap urged me to acquire a certain amount of elementary erudition. But,\\nfor a year, I was a young hermit, living with Scott in the \"Waverleys\"\\nand the \"Border Minstrelsy,\" with Pope, and Prior, and a translation of\\nAriosto, with Lever and Dickens, David Copperfield and Charles O\\'Malley,\\nLongfellow and Mayne Reid, Dumas, and in brief, with every kind of light\\nliterature that I could lay my hands upon. Carlyle did not escape me; I\\nvividly remember the helpless rage with which I read of the Flight to\\nVarennes. In his work on French novelists, Mr. Saintsbury speaks of a\\ndisagreeable little boy, in a French romance, who found Scott\\n_assommant_, stunningly stupid. This was a very odious little boy, it\\nseems (I have not read his adventures), and he came, as he deserved, to a\\nbad end. Other and better boys, I learn, find Scott \"slow.\"\\nExtraordinary boys! Perhaps \"Ivanhoe\" was first favourite of yore; you\\ncannot beat Front de Boeuf, the assault on his castle, the tournament. No\\nother tournament need apply. Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, greatly daring, has\\nattempted to enter the lists, but he is a mere Ralph the Hospitaller.\\nNext, I think, in order of delight, came \"Quentin Durward,\" especially\\nthe hero of the scar, whose name Thackeray could not remember, Quentin\\'s\\nuncle. Then \"The Black Dwarf,\" and Dugald, our dear Rittmeister. I\\ncould not read \"Rob Roy\" then, nor later; nay, not till I was forty. Now\\nDi Vernon is the lady for me; the queen of fiction, the peerless, the\\nbrave, the tender, and true.\\nThe wisdom of the authorities decided that I was to read no more novels,\\nbut, as an observer remarked, \"I don\\'t see what is the use of preventing\\nthe boy from reading novels, for he\\'s just reading \\'Don Juan\\' instead.\"\\nThis was so manifestly no improvement, that the ban on novels was tacitly\\nwithdrawn, or was permitted to become a dead letter. They were far more\\nenjoyable than Byron. The worst that came of this was the suggestion of\\na young friend, whose life had been adventurous--indeed he had served in\\nthe Crimea with the Bashi Bazouks--that I should master the writings of\\nEdgar Poe. I do not think that the \"Black Cat,\" and the \"Fall of the\\nHouse of Usher,\" and the \"Murders in the Rue Morgue,\" are very good\\nreading for a boy who is not peculiarly intrepid. Many a bad hour they\\ngave me, haunting me, especially, with a fear of being prematurely\\nburied, and of waking up before breakfast to find myself in a coffin. Of\\nall the books I devoured in that year, Poe is the only author whom I wish\\nI had reserved for later consideration, and whom I cannot conscientiously\\nrecommend to children.\\nI had already enjoyed a sip of Thackeray, reading at a venture, in\\n\"Vanity Fair,\" about the Battle of Waterloo. It was not like Lever\\'s\\naccounts of battles, but it was enchanting. However, \"Vanity Fair\" was\\nunder a taboo. It is not easy to say why; but Mr. Thackeray himself\\ninformed a small boy, whom he found reading \"Vanity Fair\" under the\\ntable, that he had better read something else. What harm can the story\\ndo to a child? He reads about Waterloo, about fat Jos, about little\\nGeorge and the pony, about little Rawdon and the rat-hunt, and is happy\\nand unharmed.\\nLeaving my hermitage, and going into the very different and very\\ndisagreeable world of a master\\'s house, I was lucky enough to find a\\ncharming library there. Most of Thackeray was on the shelves, and\\nThackeray became the chief enchanter. As Henry Kingsley says, a boy\\nreads him and thinks he knows all about life. I do not think that the\\nmundane parts, about Lady Kew and her wiles, about Ethel and the Marquis\\nof Farintosh, appealed to one or enlightened one. Ethel was a mystery,\\nand not an interesting mystery, though one used to copy Doyle\\'s pictures\\nof her, with the straight nose, the impossible eyes, the impossible\\nwaist. It was not Ethel who captivated us; it was Clive\\'s youth and art,\\nit was J. J., the painter, it was jolly F. B. and his address to the maid\\nabout the lobster. \"A finer fish, Mary, my dear, I have never seen. Does\\nnot this solve the vexed question whether lobsters are fish, in the\\nFrench sense?\" Then \"The Rose and the Ring\" came out. It was worth\\nwhile to be twelve years old, when the Christmas books were written by\\nDickens and Thackeray. I got hold of \"The Rose and the Ring,\" I know,\\nand of the \"Christmas Carol,\" when they were damp from the press. King\\nValoroso, and Bulbo, and Angelica were even more delightful than Scrooge,\\nand Tiny Tim, and Trotty Veck. One remembers the fairy monarch more\\nvividly, and the wondrous array of egg-cups from which he sipped\\nbrandy--or was it right Nantes?--still \"going on sipping, I am sorry to\\nsay,\" even after \"Valoroso was himself again.\"\\nBut, of all Thackeray\\'s books, I suppose \"Pendennis\" was the favourite.\\nThe delightful Marryat had entertained us with Peter Simple and O\\'Brien\\n(how good their flight through France is!) with Mesty and Mr. Midshipman\\nEasy, with Jacob Faithful (Mr. Thackeray\\'s favourite), and with\\nSnarleyyow; but Marryat never made us wish to run away to sea. That did\\nnot seem to be one\\'s vocation. But the story of Pen made one wish to run\\naway to literature, to the Temple, to streets where Brown, the famous\\nreviewer, might be seen walking with his wife and umbrella. The writing\\nof poems \"up to\" pictures, the beer with Warrington in the mornings, the\\nsuppers in the back-kitchen, these were the alluring things, not society,\\nand Lady Rockminster, and Lord Steyne. Well, one has run away to\\nliterature since, but where is the matutinal beer? Where is the back-\\nkitchen? Where are Warrington, and Foker, and F. B.? I have never met\\nthem in this living world, though Brown, the celebrated reviewer, is\\nfamiliar to me, and also Mr. Sydney Scraper, of the Oxford and Cambridge\\nClub. Perhaps back-kitchens exist, perhaps there are cakes and ale in\\nthe life literary, and F. B. may take his walks by the Round Pond. But\\none never encounters these rarities, and Bungay and Bacon are no longer\\nthe innocent and ignorant rivals whom Thackeray drew. They do not give\\nthose wonderful parties; Miss Bunnion has become quite conventional;\\nPercy Popjoy has abandoned letters; Mr. Wenham does not toady; Mr. Wagg\\ndoes not joke any more. The literary life is very like any other, in\\nLondon, or is it that we do not see it aright, not having the eyes of\\ngenius? Well, a life on the ocean wave, too, may not be so desirable as\\nit seems in Marryat\\'s novels: so many a lad whom he tempted into the navy\\nhas discovered. The best part of the existence of a man of letters is\\nhis looking forward to it through the spectacles of Titmarsh.\\nOne can never say how much one owes to a school-master who was a friend\\nof literature, who kept a houseful of books, and who was himself a\\ngraceful scholar, and an author, while he chose to write, of poetic and\\nhumorous genius. Such was the master who wrote the \"Day Dreams of a\\nSchoolmaster,\" Mr. D\\'Arcy Wentworth Thompson, to whom, in this place, I\\nam glad to confess my gratitude after all these many years. While we\\nwere deep in the history of Pendennis we were also being dragged through\\nthe Commentaries of Caius Julius Caesar, through the Latin and Greek\\ngrammars, through Xenophon, and the Eclogues of Virgil, and a depressing\\nplay of Euripides, the \"Phoenissae.\" I can never say how much I detested\\nthese authors, who, taken in small doses, are far, indeed, from being\\nattractive. Horace, to a lazy boy, appears in his Odes to have nothing\\nto say, and to say it in the most frivolous and vexatious manner. Then\\nCowper\\'s \"Task,\" or \"Paradise Lost,\" as school-books, with notes, seems\\narid enough to a school-boy. I remember reading ahead, in Cowper,\\ninstead of attending to the lesson and the class-work. His observations\\non public schools were not uninteresting, but the whole English school-\\nwork of those days was repugnant. One\\'s English education was all got\\nout of school.\\nAs to Greek, for years it seemed a mere vacuous terror; one invented for\\none\\'s self all the current arguments against \"compulsory Greek.\" What\\nwas the use of it, who ever spoke in it, who could find any sense in it,\\nor any interest? A language with such cruel superfluities as a middle\\nvoice and a dual; a language whose verbs were so fantastically irregular,\\nlooked like a barbaric survival, a mere plague and torment. So one\\nthought till Homer was opened before us. Elsewhere I have tried to\\ndescribe the vivid delight of first reading Homer, delight, by the way,\\nwhich St. Augustine failed to appreciate. Most boys not wholly immersed\\nin dulness felt it, I think; to myself, for one, Homer was the real\\nbeginning of study. One had tried him, when one was very young, in Pope,\\nand had been baffled by Pope, and his artificial manner, his \"fairs,\" and\\n\"swains.\" Homer seemed better reading in the absurd \"crib\" which Mr.\\nBuckley wrote for Bohn\\'s series. Hector and Ajax, in that disguise, were\\nas great favourites as Horatius on the Bridge, or the younger Tarquin.\\nScott, by the way, must have made one a furious and consistent\\nLegitimist. In reading the \"Lays of Ancient Rome,\" my sympathies were\\nwith the expelled kings, at least with him who fought so well at Lake\\nRegillus:--\\n \"Titus, the youngest Tarquin,\\n Too good for such a breed.\"\\nWhere--\\n \"Valerius struck at Titus,\\n And lopped off half his crest;\\n But Titus stabbed Valerius\\n A span deep in the breast,\"--\\nI find, on the margin of my old copy, in a schoolboy\\'s hand, the words\\n\"Well done, the Jacobites!\" Perhaps my politics have never gone much\\nbeyond this sentiment. But this is a digression from Homer. The very\\nsound of the hexameter, that long, inimitable roll of the most various\\nmusic, was enough to win the heart, even if the words were not\\nunderstood. But the words proved unexpectedly easy to understand, full\\nas they are of all nobility, all tenderness, all courage, courtesy, and\\nromance. The \"Morte d\\'Arthur\" itself, which about this time fell into\\nour hands, was not so dear as the \"Odyssey,\" though for a boy to read Sir\\nThomas Malory is to ride at adventure in enchanted forests, to enter\\nhaunted chapels where a light shines from the Graal, to find by lonely\\nmountain meres the magic boat of Sir Galahad.\\nAfter once being initiated into the mysteries of Greece by Homer, the\\nwork at Greek was no longer tedious. Herodotus was a charming and\\nhumorous story-teller, and, as for Thucydides, his account of the\\nSicilian Expedition and its ending was one of the very rare things in\\nliterature which almost, if not quite, brought tears into one\\'s eyes. Few\\npassages, indeed, have done that, and they are curiously discrepant. The\\nfirst book that ever made me cry, of which feat I was horribly ashamed,\\nwas \"Uncle Tom\\'s Cabin,\" with the death of Eva, Topsy\\'s friend. Then it\\nwas trying when Colonel Newcome said _Adsum_, and the end of Socrates in\\nthe _Phaedo_ moved one more than seemed becoming--these, and a passage in\\nthe history of Skalagrim Lamb\\'s Tail, and, as I said, the ruin of the\\nAthenians in the Syracusan Bay. I have read these chapters in an old\\nFrench version derived through the Italian from a Latin translation of\\nThucydides. Even in this far-descended form, the tale keeps its pathos;\\nthe calm, grave stamp of that tragic telling cannot be worn away by much\\nhandling, by long time, by the many changes of human speech. \"Others\\ntoo,\" says Nicias, in that fatal speech, when--\\n \"_All was done that men may do_,\\n _And all was done in vain_,\"--\\n\"having achieved what men may, have borne what men must.\" This is the\\nvery burden of life, and the last word of tragedy. For now all is vain:\\ncourage, wisdom, piety, the bravery of Lamachus, the goodness of Nicias,\\nthe brilliance of Alcibiades, all are expended, all wasted, nothing of\\nthat brave venture abides, except torture, defeat, and death. No play\\nnot poem of individual fortunes is so moving as this ruin of a people; no\\nmodern story can stir us, with all its eloquence, like the brief gravity\\nof this ancient history. Nor can we find, at the last, any wisdom more\\nwise than that which bids us do what men may, and bear what men must.\\nSuch are the lessons of the Greek, of the people who tried all things, in\\nthe morning of the world, and who still speak to us of what they tried in\\nwords which are the sum of human gaiety and gloom, of grief and triumph,\\nhope and despair. The world, since their day, has but followed in the\\nsame round, which only seems new: has only made the same experiments, and\\nfailed with the same failure, but less gallantly and less gloriously.\\nOne\\'s school-boy adventures among books ended not long after winning the\\nfriendship of Homer and Thucydides, of Lucretius and Catullus. One\\'s\\napplication was far too desultory to make a serious and accurate scholar.\\nI confess to having learned the classical languages, as it were by\\naccident, for the sake of what is in them, and with a provokingly\\nimperfect accuracy. Cricket and trout occupied far too much of my mind\\nand my time: Christopher North, and Walton, and Thomas Tod Stoddart, and\\n\"The Moor and the Loch,\" were my holiday reading, and I do not regret it.\\nPhilologists and Ireland scholars are not made so, but you can, in no\\nway, fashion a scholar out of a casual and inaccurate intelligence. The\\ntrue scholar is one whom I envy, almost as much as I respect him; but\\nthere is a kind of mental short-sightedness, where accents and verbal\\nniceties are concerned, which cannot be sharpened into true scholarship.\\nYet, even for those afflicted in this way, and with the malady of being\\n\"idle, careless little boys,\" the ancient classics have a value for which\\nthere is no substitute. There is a charm in finding ourselves--our\\ncommon humanity, our puzzles, our cares, our joys, in the writings of men\\nsevered from us by race, religion, speech, and half the gulf of\\nhistorical time--which no other literary pleasure can equal. Then there\\nis to be added, as the university preacher observed, \"the pleasure of\\ndespising our fellow-creatures who do not know Greek.\" Doubtless in that\\nthere is great consolation.\\nIt would be interesting, were it possible, to know what proportion of\\npeople really care for poetry, and how the love of poetry came to them,\\nand grew in them, and where and when it stopped. Modern poets whom one\\nmeets are apt to say that poetry is not read at all. Byron\\'s Murray\\nceased to publish poetry in 1830, just when Tennyson and Browning were\\nstriking their preludes. Probably Mr. Murray was wise in his generation.\\nBut it is also likely that many persons, even now, are attached to\\npoetry, though they certainly do not buy contemporary verse. How did the\\npassion come to them? How long did it stay? When did the Muse say good-\\nbye? To myself, as I have remarked, poetry came with Sir Walter Scott,\\nfor one read Shakespeare as a child, rather in a kind of dream of\\nfairyland and enchanted isles, than with any distinct consciousness that\\none was occupied with poetry. Next to Scott, with me, came Longfellow,\\nwho pleased one as more reflective and tenderly sentimental, while the\\nreflections were not so deep as to be puzzling. I remember how\\n\"Hiawatha\" came out, when one was a boy, and how delightful was the free\\nforest life, and Minnehaha, and Paupukkeewis, and Nokomis. One did not\\nthen know that the same charm, with a yet fresher dew upon it, was to\\nmeet one later, in the \"Kalewala.\" But, at that time, one had no\\nconscious pleasure in poetic style, except in such ringing verse as\\nScott\\'s, and Campbell\\'s in his patriotic pieces. The pleasure and\\nenchantment of style first appealed to me, at about the age of fifteen,\\nwhen one read for the first time--\\n \"So all day long the noise of battle rolled\\n Among the mountains by the winter sea;\\n Until King Arthur\\'s Table, man by man,\\n Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their Lord.\"\\nPreviously one had only heard of Mr. Tennyson as a name. When a child I\\nwas told that a poet was coming to a house in the Highlands where we\\nchanced to be, a poet named Tennyson. \"Is he a poet like Sir Walter\\nScott?\" I remember asking, and was told, \"No, he was not like Sir Walter\\nScott.\" Hearing no more of him, I was prowling among the books in an\\nancient house, a rambling old place with a ghost-room, where I found\\nTupper, and could not get on with \"Proverbial Philosophy.\" Next I tried\\nTennyson, and instantly a new light of poetry dawned, a new music was\\naudible, a new god came into my medley of a Pantheon, a god never to be\\ndethroned. \"Men scarcely know how beautiful fire is,\" Shelley says. I\\nam convinced that we scarcely know how great a poet Lord Tennyson is; use\\nhas made him too familiar. The same hand has \"raised the Table Round\\nagain,\" that has written the sacred book of friendship, that has lulled\\nus with the magic of the \"Lotus Eaters,\" and the melody of \"Tithonus.\" He\\nhas made us move, like his own Prince--\\n \"Among a world of ghosts,\\n And feel ourselves the shadows of a dream.\"\\nHe has enriched our world with conquests of romance; he has recut and\\nreset a thousand ancient gems of Greece and Rome; he has roused our\\npatriotism; he has stirred our pity; there is hardly a human passion but\\nhe has purged it and ennobled it, including \"this of love.\" Truly, the\\nLaureate remains the most various, the sweetest, the most exquisite, the\\nmost learned, the most Virgilian of all English poets, and we may pity\\nthe lovers of poetry who died before Tennyson came.\\nHere may end the desultory tale of a desultory bookish boyhood. It was\\nnot in nature that one should not begin to rhyme for one\\'s self. But\\nthose exercises were seldom even written down; they lived a little while\\nin a memory which has lost them long ago. I do remember me that I tried\\nsome of my attempts on my dear mother, who said much what Dryden said to\\n\"Cousin Swift,\" \"You will never be a poet,\" a decision in which I\\nstraightway acquiesced. For to rhyme is one thing, to be a poet quite\\nanother. A good deal of mortification would be avoided if young men and\\nmaidens only kept this obvious fact well posed in front of their vanity\\nand their ambition.\\nIn these bookish memories I have said nothing about religion and\\nreligious books, for various reasons. But, unlike other Scots of the\\npen, I got no harm from \"The Shorter Catechism,\" of which I remember\\nlittle, and neither then nor now was or am able to understand a single\\nsentence. Some precocious metaphysicians comprehended and stood aghast\\nat justification, sanctification, adoption, and effectual calling. These,\\napparently, were necessary processes in the Scottish spiritual life. But\\nwe were not told what they meant, nor were we distressed by a sense that\\nwe had not passed through them. From most children, one trusts,\\nCalvinism ran like water off a duck\\'s back; unlucky were they who first\\nabsorbed, and later were compelled to get rid of, \"The Shorter\\nCatechism!\"\\nOne good thing, if no more, these memories may accomplish. Young men,\\nespecially in America, write to me and ask me to recommend \"a course of\\nreading.\" Distrust a course of reading! People who really care for\\nbooks _read all of them_. There is no other course. Let this be a\\nreply. No other answer shall they get from me, the inquiring young men.\\nII\\nPeople talk, in novels, about the delights of a first love. One may\\nventure to doubt whether everybody exactly knows which was his, or her,\\nfirst love, of men or women, but about our first loves in books there can\\nbe no mistake. They were, and remain, the dearest of all; after boyhood\\nthe bloom is off the literary rye. The first parcel of these garrulities\\nended when the author left school, at about the age of seventeen. One\\'s\\nliterary equipment seems to have been then almost as complete as it ever\\nwill be, one\\'s tastes definitely formed, one\\'s favourites already chosen.\\nAs long as we live we hope to read, but we never can \"recapture the first\\nfine careless rapture.\" Besides, one begins to write, and that is fatal.\\nMy own first essays were composed at school--for other boys. Not long\\nago the gentleman who was then our English master wrote to me, informing\\nme he was my earliest public, and that he had never credited my younger\\nbrother with the essays which that unscrupulous lad (\"I speak of him but\\nbrotherly\") was accustomed to present for his consideration.\\nOn leaving school at seventeen I went to St. Leonard\\'s Hall, in the\\nUniversity of St. Andrews. That is the oldest of Scotch universities,\\nand was founded by a papal bull. St. Leonard\\'s Hall, after having been a\\n_hospitium_ for pilgrims, a home for old ladies (about 1500), and a\\ncollege in the University, was now a kind of cross between a master\\'s\\nhouse at school, and, as before 1750, a college. We had more liberty\\nthan schoolboys, less than English undergraduates. In the Scotch\\nuniversities the men live scattered, in lodgings, and only recently, at\\nSt. Andrews, have they begun to dine together in hall. We had a common\\nroof, common dinners, wore scarlet gowns, possessed football and cricket\\nclubs, and started, of course, a kind of weekly magazine. It was only a\\nmanuscript affair, and was profusely illustrated. For the only time in\\nmy life, I was now an editor, under a sub-editor, who kept me up to my\\nwork, and cut out my fine passages. The editor\\'s duty was to write most\\nof the magazine--to write essays, reviews (of books by the professors,\\nvery severe), novels, short stories, poems, translations, also to\\nillustrate these, and to \"fag\" his friends for \"copy\" and drawings. A\\ndeplorable flippancy seems, as far as one remembers, to have been the\\nchief characteristic of the periodical--flippancy and an abundant use of\\nthe supernatural. These were the days of Lord\\' Lytton\\'s \"Strange Story,\"\\nwhich I continue to think a most satisfactory romance. Inspired by Lord\\nLytton, and aided by the University library, I read Cornelius Agrippa,\\nTrithemius, Petrus de Abano, Michael Scott, and struggled with Iamblichus\\nand Plotinus.\\nThese are really but disappointing writers. It soon became evident\\nenough that the devil was not to be raised by their prescriptions, that\\nthe philosopher\\'s stone was beyond the reach of the amateur. Iamblichus\\nis particularly obscure and tedious. To any young beginner I would\\nrecommend Petrus de Abano, as the most adequate and gruesome of the\\nschool, for \"real deevilry and pleesure,\" while in the wilderness of\\nPlotinus there are many beautiful passages and lofty speculations. Two\\nwinters in the Northern University, with the seamy side of school life\\nleft behind, among the kindest of professors--Mr. Sellar, Mr. Ferrier,\\nMr. Shairp--in the society of the warden, Mr. Rhoades, and of many dear\\nold friends, are the happiest time in my life. This was true literary\\nleisure, even if it was not too well employed, and the _religio loci_\\nshould be a liberal education in itself. We had debating societies--I\\nhope I am now forgiven for an attack on the character of Sir William\\nWallace, _latro quidam_, as the chronicler calls him, \"a certain\\nbrigand.\" But I am for ever writing about St. Andrews--writing\\ninaccurately, too, the Scotch critics declare. \"Farewell,\" we cried,\\n\"dear city of youth and dream,\" eternally dear and sacred.\\nHere we first made acquaintance with Mr. Browning, guided to his works by\\na parody which a lady wrote in our little magazine. Mr. Browning was not\\na popular poet in 1861. His admirers were few, a little people, but they\\nwere not then in the later mood of reverence, they did not awfully\\nquestion the oracles, as in after years. They read, they admired, they\\napplauded, on occasion they mocked, good-humouredly. The book by which\\nMr. Browning was best known was the two green volumes of \"Men and Women.\"\\nIn these, I still think, is the heart of his genius beating most\\nstrenuously and with an immortal vitality. Perhaps this, for its\\ncompass, is the collection of poetry the most various and rich of modern\\nEnglish times, almost of any English times. But just as Mr. Fitzgerald\\ncared little for what Lord Tennyson wrote after 1842, so I have never\\nbeen able to feel quite the same enthusiasm for Mr. Browning\\'s work after\\n\"Men and Women.\" He seems to have more influence, though that influence\\nis vague, on persons who chiefly care for thought, than on those who\\nchiefly care for poetry. I have met a lady who had read \"The Ring and\\nthe Book\" often, the \"Lotus Eaters\" not once. Among such students are\\nMr. Browning\\'s disciples of the Inner Court: I dwell but in the Court of\\nthe Gentiles. While we all--all who attempt rhyme--have more or less\\nconsciously imitated the manner of Lord Tennyson, Mr. Swinburne, Mr.\\nRossetti, such imitations of Mr. Browning are uncommonly scarce. He is\\nlucky enough not to have had the seed of his flower stolen and sown\\neverywhere till--\\n \"Once again the people\\n Called it but a weed.\"\\nThe other new poet of these days was Mr. Clough, who has many\\nundergraduate qualities. But his peculiar wistful scepticism in religion\\nhad then no influence on such of us as were still happily in the ages of\\nfaith. Anything like doubt comes less of reading, perhaps, than of the\\nsudden necessity which, in almost every life, puts belief on her trial,\\nand cries for an examination of the creeds hitherto held upon authority,\\nand by dint of use and wont. In a different way one can hardly care for\\nMr. Matthew Arnold, as a boy, till one has come under the influence of\\nOxford. So Mr. Browning was the only poet added to my pantheon at St.\\nAndrews, though Macaulay then was admitted and appeared to be more the\\ntrue model of a prose writer than he seems in the light of later\\nreflection. Probably we all have a period of admiring Carlyle almost\\nexclusively. College essays, when the essayist cares for his work, are\\ngenerally based on one or the other. Then they recede into the\\nbackground. As for their thought, we cannot for ever remain disciples.\\nWe begin to see how much that looks like thought is really the expression\\nof temperament, and how individual a thing temperament is, how each of us\\nmust construct his world for himself, or be content to wait for an answer\\nand a synthesis \"in that far-off divine event to which the whole creation\\nmoves.\" So, for one, in these high matters, I must be content as a\\n\"masterless man\" swearing by no philosopher, unless he be the imperial\\nStoic of the hardy heart, Marcus Aurelius Antoninus.\\nPerhaps nothing in education encourages this incredulity about \"masters\"\\nof thought like the history of philosophy. The professor of moral\\nphilosophy, Mr. Ferrier, was a famous metaphysician and scholar. His\\nlectures on \"The History of Greek Philosophy\" were an admirable\\nintroduction to the subject, afterwards pursued, in the original\\nauthorities, at Oxford. Mr. Ferrier was an exponent of other men\\'s ideas\\nso fair and persuasive that, in each new school, we thought we had\\ndiscovered the secret. We were physicists with Thales and that\\npre-Socratic \"company of gallant gentlemen\" for whom Sydney Smith\\nconfessed his lack of admiration. We were now Empedocleans, now\\nbelievers in Heraclitus, now in Socrates, now in Plato, now in Aristotle.\\nIn each lecture our professor set up a new master and gently\\ndisintegrated him in the next. \"Amurath to Amurath succeeds,\" as Mr. T.\\nH. Green used to say at Oxford. He himself became an Amurath, a sultan\\nof thought, even before his apotheosis as the guide of that bewildered\\nclergyman, Mr. Robert Elsmere. At Oxford, when one went there, one found\\nMr. Green already in the position of a leader of thought, and of young\\nmen. He was a tutor of Balliol, and lectured on Aristotle, and of him\\neager youth said, in the words of Omar Khayyam, \"_He knows_! _he knows_!\"\\nWhat was it that Mr. Green knew? Where was the secret? To a mind\\nalready sceptical about masters, it seemed that the secret (apart from\\nthe tutor\\'s noble simplicity and rare elevation of character) was a knack\\nof translating St. John and Aristotle alike into a terminology which we\\nthen believed to be Hegelian. Hegel we knew, not in the original German,\\nbut in lectures and in translations. Reasoning from these inadequate\\npremises, it seemed to me that Hegel had invented evolution before Mr.\\nDarwin, that his system showed, so to speak, the spirit at work in\\nevolution, the something within the wheels. But this was only a personal\\nimpression made on a mind which knew Darwin, and physical speculations in\\ngeneral, merely in the vague popular way. Mr. Green\\'s pupils could\\ngenerally write in his own language, more or less, and could \"envisage\"\\nthings, as we said then, from his point of view. To do this was\\nbelieved, probably without cause, to be useful in examinations. For one,\\nI could never take it much more seriously, never believed that \"the\\nAbsolute,\" as the _Oxford Spectator_ said, had really been \"got into a\\ncorner.\" The Absolute has too often been apparently cornered, too often\\nhas escaped from that situation. Somewhere in an old notebook I believe\\nI have a portrait in pencil of Mr. Green as he wrestled at lecture with\\nAristotle, with the Notion, with his chair and table. Perhaps he was the\\nlast of that remarkable series of men, who may have begun with Wycliffe,\\namong whom Newman\\'s is a famous name, that were successively accepted at\\nOxford as knowing something esoteric, as possessing a shrewd guess at the\\nsecret.\\n \"None the less\\n I still came out no wiser than I went.\"\\nAll of these masters and teachers made their mark, probably won their\\nhold, in the first place, by dint of character, not of some peculiar\\nviews of theology and philosophy. Doubtless it was the same with\\nSocrates, with Buddha. To be like them, not to believe with them, is the\\nthing needful. But the younger we are, the less, perhaps, we see this\\nclearly, and we persuade ourselves that there is some mystery in these\\nmen\\'s possession, some piece of knowledge, some method of thinking which\\nwill lead us to certainty and to peace. Alas, their secret is\\nincommunicable, and there is no more a philosophic than there is a royal\\nroad to the City.\\nThis may seem a digression from Adventures among Books into the Book of\\nHuman Life. But while much of education is still orally communicated by\\nlectures and conversations, many thoughts which are to be found in books,\\nGreek or German, reach us through the hearing. There are many pupils who\\ncan best be taught in this way; but, for one, if there be aught that is\\ndesirable in a book, I then, as now, preferred, if I could, to go to the\\nbook for it.\\nYet it is odd that one remembers so little of one\\'s undergraduate\\nreadings, apart from the constant study of the ancient classics, which\\nmight not be escaped. Of these the calm wisdom of Aristotle, in moral\\nthought and in politics, made perhaps the deepest impression. Probably\\npoliticians are the last people who read Aristotle\\'s \"Politics.\" The\\nwork is, indeed, apt to disenchant one with political life. It is\\nmelancholy to see the little Greek states running the regular\\nround--monarchy, oligarchy, tyranny, democracy in all its degrees, the\\n\"ultimate democracy\" of plunder, lawlessness, license of women, children,\\nand slaves, and then tyranny again, or subjection to some foreign power.\\nIn politics, too, there is no secret of success, of the happy life for\\nall. There is no such road to the City, either democratic or royal. This\\nis the lesson which Aristotle\\'s \"Polities\" impresses on us, this and the\\nimpossibility of imposing ideal constitutions on mankind.\\n\"Whate\\'er is best administered is best.\" These are some of the\\nimpressions made at Oxford by the studies of the schools, the more or\\nless inevitable \"curricoolum,\" as the Scotch gentleman pronounced the\\nword. But at Oxford, for most men, the regular work of the schools is\\nonly a small part of the literary education. People read, in different\\ndegrees, according to their private tastes. There are always a few men,\\nat least, who love literary studies for their own sake, regardless of\\nlectures and of \"classes.\" In my own time I really believe you could\\nknow nothing which might not \"pay\" in the schools and prove serviceable\\nin examinations. But a good deal depended on being able to use your\\nknowledge by way of literary illustration. Perhaps the cleverest of my\\nown juniors, since very well known in letters, did not use his own\\nspecial vein, even when he had the chance, in writing answers to\\nquestions in examinations. Hence his academic success was much below his\\ndeserts. For my own part, I remember my tutor saying, \"Don\\'t write as if\\nyou were writing for a penny paper.\" Alas, it was \"a prediction, cruel,\\nsmart.\" But, \"as yet no sin was dreamed.\"\\nAt my own college we had to write weekly essays, alternately in English\\nand Latin. This might have been good literary training, but I fear the\\nessays were not taken very seriously. The chief object was to make the\\nlate learned Dr. Scott bound on his chair by paradoxes. But nobody ever\\nsucceeded. He was experienced in trash. As for what may be called\\nunacademic literature, there were not many essays in that art. There\\nhave been very literary generations, as when Corydon and Thyrsis \"lived\\nin Oxford as if it had been a great country house;\" so Corydon confessed.\\nProbably many of the poems by Mr. Matthew Arnold and many of Mr.\\nSwinburne\\'s early works were undergraduate poems. A later generation\\nproduced \"Love in Idleness,\" a very pleasing volume. But the gods had\\nnot made us poetical. In those days I remember picking up, in the Union\\nReading-room, a pretty white quarto, \"Atalanta in Calydon,\" by A. C.\\nSwinburne. Only once had I seen Mr. Swinburne\\'s name before, signing a\\nbrief tale in _Once a Week_. \"Atalanta\" was a revelation; there was a\\nnew and original poet here, a Balliol man, too. In my own mind\\n\"Atalanta\" remains the best, the most beautiful, the most musical of Mr.\\nSwinburne\\'s many poems. He instantly became the easily parodied model of\\nundergraduate versifiers.\\nSwinburnian prize poems, even, were attempted, without success. As yet\\nwe had not seen Mr. Matthew Arnold\\'s verses. I fell in love with them,\\none long vacation, and never fell out of love. He is not, and cannot be,\\nthe poet of the wide world, but his charm is all the more powerful over\\nthose whom he attracts and subdues. He is the one Oxford poet of Oxford,\\nand his \"Scholar Gypsy\" is our \"Lycidas.\" At this time he was Professor\\nof Poetry; but, alas, he lectured just at the hour when wickets were\\npitched on Cowley Marsh, and I never was present at his discourses, at\\nhis humorous prophecies of England\\'s fate, which are coming all too true.\\nSo many weary lectures had to be attended, could not be \"cut,\" that we\\nabstained from lectures of supererogation, so to speak. For the rest\\nthere was no \"literary movement\" among contemporary undergraduates. They\\nread for the schools, and they rowed and played cricket. We had no\\npoets, except the stroke of the Corpus boat, Mr. Bridges, and he\\nconcealed his courtship of the Muse. Corpus is a small college, but Mr.\\nBridges pulled its boat to the proud place of second on the river. B. N.\\nC. was the head boat, and even B. N. C. did Corpus bump. But the triumph\\nwas brief. B. N. C. made changes in its crew, got a new ship, drank the\\nfoaming grape, and bumped Corpus back. I think they went head next year,\\nbut not that year. Thus Mr. Bridges, as Kingsley advises, was doing\\nnoble deeds, not dreaming them, at that moment.\\nThere existed a periodical entirely devoted to verse, but nobody knew\\nanybody who wrote in it. A comic journal was started; I remember the\\npride with which when a freshman, I received an invitation to join its\\ncouncils as an artist. I was to do the caricatures of all things. Now,\\nmethought, I shall meet the Oxford wits of whom I have read. But the\\nwits were unutterably disappointing, and the whole thing died early and\\nnot lamented. Only one piece of academic literature obtained and\\ndeserved success. This was _The Oxford Spectator_, a most humorous\\nlittle periodical, in shape and size like Addison\\'s famous journal. The\\nauthors were Mr. Reginald Copleston, now Bishop of Colombo, Mr. Humphry\\nWard, and Mr. Nolan, a great athlete, who died early. There have been\\ngood periodicals since; many amusing things occur in the _Echoes from the\\nOxford Magazine_, but the _Spectator_ was the flower of academic\\njournals. \"When I look back to my own experience,\" says the _Spectator_,\\n\"I find one scene, of all Oxford, most deeply engraved upon \\'the mindful\\ntablets of my soul.\\' And yet not a scene, but a fairy compound of smell\\nand sound, and sight and thought. The wonderful scent of the meadow air\\njust above Iffley, on a hot May evening, and the gay colours of twenty\\nboats along the shore, the poles all stretched out from the bank to set\\nthe boats clear, and the sonorous cries of \\'ten seconds more,\\' all down\\nfrom the green barge to the lasher. And yet that unrivalled moment is\\nonly typical of all the term; the various elements of beauty and pleasure\\nare concentrated there.\"\\nUnfortunately, life at Oxford is not all beauty and pleasure. Things go\\nwrong somehow. Life drops her happy mask. But this has nothing to do\\nwith books.\\nAbout books, however, I have not many more confessions that I care to\\nmake. A man\\'s old self is so far away that he can speak about it and its\\nadventures almost as if he were speaking about another who is dead. After\\ntaking one\\'s degree, and beginning to write a little for publication, the\\ntopic has a tendency to become much more personal. My last undergraduate\\nliterary discoveries were of France and the Renaissance. Accidentally\\nfinding out that I could read French, I naturally betook myself to\\nBalzac. If you read him straight on, without a dictionary, you begin to\\nlearn a good many words. The literature of France has been much more\\npopular in England lately, but thirty years agone it was somewhat\\nneglected. There does seem to be something in French poetry which fails\\nto please \"the German paste in our composition.\" Mr. Matthew Arnold, a\\ndisciple of Sainte-Beuve, never could appreciate French poetry. A poet-\\ncritic has even remarked that the French language is nearly incapable of\\npoetry! We cannot argue in such matters, where all depends on the taste\\nand the ear.\\nOur ancestors, like the author of the \"Faery Queen,\" translated and\\nadmired Du Bellay and Ronsard; to some critics of our own time this taste\\nseems a modish affectation. For one, I have ever found an original charm\\nin the lyrics of the Pleiad, and have taken great delight in Hugo\\'s\\namazing variety of music, in the romance of Alfred de Musset, in the\\nbeautiful cameos of Gautier. What is poetical, if not the \"Song of\\nRoland,\" the only true national epic since Homer? What is frank, natural\\nverse, if not that of the old _Pastourelles_? Where is there _naivete_\\nof narrative and unconscious charm, if not in _Aucassin et Nicolette_? In\\nthe long normally developed literature of France, so variously rich, we\\nfind the nearest analogy to the literature of Greece, though that of\\nEngland contains greater masterpieces, and her verse falls more winningly\\non the ear. France has no Shakespeare and no Milton; we have no Moliere\\nand no \"Song of Roland.\" One star differs from another in glory, but it\\nis a fortunate moment when this planet of France swims into our ken. Many\\nof our generation saw it first through Mr. Swinburne\\'s telescope, heard\\nof it in his criticisms, and are grateful to that watcher of the skies,\\neven if we do not share all his transports. There then arose at Oxford,\\nout of old French, and old oak, and old china, a \"school\" or \"movement.\"\\nIt was aesthetic, and an early purchaser of Mr. William Morris\\'s wall\\npapers. It existed ten or twelve years before the public \"caught on,\" as\\nthey say, to these delights. But, except one or two of the masters, the\\nschool were only playing at aesthetics, and laughing at their own\\nperformances. There was more fun than fashion in the cult, which was\\nlater revived, developed, and gossiped about more than enough.\\nTo a writer now dead, and then first met, I am specially bound in\\ngratitude--the late Mr. J. F. M\\'Lennan. Mr. M\\'Lennan had the most acute\\nand ingenious of minds which I have encountered. His writings on early\\nmarriage and early religion were revelations which led on to others. The\\ntopic of folklore, and the development of custom and myths, is not\\ngenerally attractive, to be sure. Only a few people seem interested in\\nthat spectacle, so full of surprises--the development of all human\\ninstitutions, from fairy tales to democracy. In beholding it we learn\\nhow we owe all things, humanly speaking, to the people and to genius. The\\nnatural people, the folk, has supplied us, in its unconscious way, with\\nthe stuff of all our poetry, law, ritual: and genius has selected from\\nthe mass, has turned customs into codes, nursery tales into romance, myth\\ninto science, ballad into epic, magic mummery into gorgeous ritual. The\\nworld has been educated, but not as man would have trained and taught it.\\n\"He led us by a way we knew not,\" led, and is leading us, we know not\\nwhither; we follow in fear.\\nThe student of this lore can look back and see the long trodden way\\nbehind him, the winding tracks through marsh and forest and over burning\\nsands. He sees the caves, the camps, the villages, the towns where the\\nrace has tarried, for shorter times or longer, strange places many of\\nthem, and strangely haunted, desolate dwellings and inhospitable. But\\nthe scarce visible tracks converge at last on the beaten ways, the ways\\nto that city whither mankind is wandering, and which it may never win. We\\nhave a foreboding of a purpose which we know not, a sense as of will,\\nworking, as we would not have worked, to a hidden end.\\nThis is the lesson, I think, of what we call folklore or anthropology,\\nwhich to many seems trivial, to many seems dull. It may become the most\\nattractive and serious of the sciences; certainly it is rich in strange\\ncuriosities, like those mystic stones which were fingered and arrayed by\\nthe pupils in that allegory of Novalis. I am not likely to regret the\\naccident which brought me up on fairy tales, and the inquisitiveness\\nwhich led me to examine the other fragments of antiquity. But the poetry\\nand the significance of them are apt to be hidden by the enormous crowd\\nof details. Only late we find the true meaning of what seems like a mass\\nof fantastic, savage eccentricities. I very well remember the moment\\nwhen it occurred to me, soon after taking my degree, that the usual ideas\\nabout some of these matters were the reverse of the truth, that the\\ncommon theory had to be inverted. The notion was \"in the air,\" it had\\nalready flashed on Mannhardt, probably, but, like the White Knight in\\n\"Alice,\" I claimed it for \"my own invention.\"\\nThese reminiscences and reflections have now been produced as far as\\n1872, or thereabouts, and it is not my intention to pursue them further,\\nnor to speak of any living contemporaries who have not won their way to\\nthe classical. In writing of friends and teachers at Oxford, I have not\\nventured to express gratitude to those who still live, still teach, still\\nare the wisest and kindest friends of the hurrying generations. It is a\\nsilence not of thanklessness, but of respect and devotion. About\\nothers--contemporaries, or juniors by many years--who have instructed,\\nconsoled, strengthened, and amused us, we must also be silent.\\nCHAPTER II: RECOLLECTIONS OF ROBERT LOUIS STEVENSON\\n TUSITALA\\n We spoke of a rest in a Fairy hill of the north, but he\\n Far from the firths of the east and the racing tides of the west\\n Sleeps in the sight and the sound of the infinite southern sea,\\n Weary and well content, in his grave on the Vaea crest.\\n Tusitala, the lover of children, the teller of tales,\\n Giver of counsel and dreams, a wonder, a world\\'s delight,\\n Looks o\\'er the labour of men in the plain and the hill, and the sails\\n Pass and repass on the sea that he loved, in the day and the night.\\n Winds of the west and the east in the rainy season blow,\\n Heavy with perfume, and all his fragrant woods are wet,\\n Winds of the east and the west as they wander to and fro,\\n Bear him the love of the lands he loved, and the long regret.\\n Once we were kindest, he said, when leagues of the limitless sea,\\n Flowed between us, but now that no range of the refluent tides\\n Sunders us each from each, yet nearer we seem to be,\\n When only the unbridged stream of the River of Death divides.\\nBefore attempting to give any \"reminiscences\" of Mr. Stevenson, it is\\nright to observe that reminiscences of him can best be found in his own\\nworks. In his essay on \"Child\\'s Play,\" and in his \"Child\\'s Garden of\\nVerse,\" he gave to the world his vivid recollections of his imaginative\\ninfancy. In other essays he spoke of his boyhood, his health, his\\ndreams, his methods of work and study. \"The Silverado Squatters\" reveals\\npart of his experience in America. The Parisian scenes in \"The Wrecker\"\\nare inspired by his sojourn in French Bohemia; his journeys are recorded\\nin \"Travels with a Donkey\" and \"An Inland Voyage\"; while his South Sea\\nsketches, which appeared in periodicals, deal with his Oceanic\\nadventures. He was the most autobiographical of authors, with an egoism\\nnearly as complete, and to us as delightful, as the egoism of Montaigne.\\nThus, the proper sources of information about the author of \"Kidnapped\"\\nare in his delightful books.\\n\"John\\'s own John,\" as Dr. Holmes says, may be very unlike his neighbour\\'s\\nJohn; but in the case of Mr. Stevenson, his Louis was very similar to my\\nLouis; I mean that, as he presents his personality to the world in his\\nwritings, even so did that personality appear to me in our intercourse.\\nThe man I knew was always a boy.\\n \"Sing me a song of the lad that is gone,\"\\nhe wrote about Prince Charlie, but in his own case the lad was never\\n\"gone.\" Like Keats and Shelley, he was, and he looked, of the immortally\\nyoung. He and I were at school together, but I was an elderly boy of\\nseventeen, when he was lost in the crowd of \"gytes,\" as the members of\\nthe lowest form are called. Like all Scotch people, we had a vague\\nfamily connection; a great-uncle of his, I fancy, married an aunt of my\\nown, called for her beauty, \"The Flower of Ettrick.\" So we had both\\nheard; but these things were before our day. A lady of my kindred\\nremembers carrying Stevenson about when he was \"a rather peevish baby,\"\\nand I have seen a beautiful photograph of him, like one of Raffael\\'s\\nchildren, taken when his years were three or four. But I never had heard\\nof his existence till, in 1873, I think, I was at Mentone, in the\\ninterests of my health. Here I met Mr. Sidney Colvin, now of the British\\nMuseum, and, with Mr. Colvin, Stevenson. He looked as, in my eyes, he\\nalways did look, more like a lass than a lad, with a rather long, smooth\\noval face, brown hair worn at greater length than is common, large lucid\\neyes, but whether blue or brown I cannot remember, if brown, certainly\\nlight brown. On appealing to the authority of a lady, I learn that brown\\n_was_ the hue. His colour was a trifle hectic, as is not unusual at\\nMentone, but he seemed, under his big blue cloak, to be of slender, yet\\nagile frame. He was like nobody else whom I ever met. There was a sort\\nof uncommon celerity in changing expression, in thought and speech. His\\ncloak and Tyrolese hat (he would admit the innocent impeachment) were\\ndecidedly dear to him. On the frontier of Italy, why should he not do as\\nthe Italians do? It would have been well for me if I could have imitated\\nthe wearing of the cloak!\\nI shall not deny that my first impression was not wholly favourable.\\n\"Here,\" I thought, \"is one of your aesthetic young men, though a very\\nclever one.\" What the talk was about, I do not remember; probably of\\nbooks. Mr. Stevenson afterwards told me that I had spoken of Monsieur\\nPaul de St. Victor, as a fine writer, but added that \"he was not a\\nBritish sportsman.\" Mr. Stevenson himself, to my surprise, was unable to\\nwalk beyond a very short distance, and, as it soon appeared, he thought\\nhis thread of life was nearly spun. He had just written his essay,\\n\"Ordered South,\" the first of his published works, for his \"Pentland\\nRising\" pamphlet was unknown, a boy\\'s performance. On reading \"Ordered\\nSouth,\" I saw, at once, that here was a new writer, a writer indeed; one\\nwho could do what none of us, _nous autres_, could rival, or approach. I\\nwas instantly \"sealed of the Tribe of Louis,\" an admirer, a devotee, a\\nfanatic, if you please. At least my taste has never altered. From this\\nessay it is plain enough that the author (as is so common in youth, but\\nwith better reason than many have) thought himself doomed. Most of us\\nhave gone through that, the Millevoye phase, but who else has shown such\\na wise and gay acceptance of the apparently inevitable? We parted; I\\nremember little of our converse, except a shrewd and hearty piece of\\nencouragement given me by my junior, who already knew so much more of\\nlife than his senior will ever do. For he ran forth to embrace life like\\na lover: _his_ motto was never Lucy Ashton\\'s--\\n \"Vacant heart, and hand, and eye,\\n Easy live and quiet die.\"\\nMr. Stevenson came presently to visit me at Oxford. I make no hand of\\nreminiscences; I remember nothing about what we did or said, with one\\nexception, which is not going to be published. I heard of him, writing\\nessays in the _Portfolio_ and the _Cornhill_, those delightful views of\\nlife at twenty-five, so brave, so real, so vivid, so wise, so exquisite,\\nwhich all should know. How we looked for \"R. L. S.\" at the end of an\\narticle, and how devout was our belief, how happy our pride, in the young\\none!\\nAbout 1878, I think (I was now a slave of the quill myself), I received a\\nbrief note from Mr. Stevenson, introducing to me the person whom, in his\\nessay on his old college magazine, he called \"Glasgow Brown.\" What his\\nreal name was, whence he came, whence the money came, I never knew. G.\\nB. was going to start a weekly Tory paper. Would I contribute? G. B.\\ncame to see me. Mr. Stevenson has described him, _not_ as I would have\\ndescribed him: like Mr. Bill Sikes\\'s dog, I have the Christian\\npeculiarity of not liking dogs \"as are not of my breed.\" G. B.\\'s paper,\\n_London_, was to start next week. He had no writer of political leading\\narticles. Would I do a \"leader\"? But I was _not_ in favour of Lord\\nLytton\\'s Afghan policy. How could I do a Tory leader? Well, I did a\\nneutral-tinted thing, with citations from Aristophanes! I found\\npresently some other scribes for G. B.\\nWhat a paper that was! I have heard that G. B. paid in handfuls of gold,\\nin handfuls of bank-notes. Nobody ever read _London_, or advertised in\\nit, or heard of it. It was full of the most wonderfully clever verses in\\nold French forms. They were (it afterwards appeared) by Mr. W. E.\\nHenley. Mr. Stevenson himself astonished and delighted the public of\\n_London_ (that is, the contributors) by his \"New Arabian Nights.\" Nobody\\nknew about them but ourselves, a fortunate few. Poor G. B. died and Mr.\\nHenley became the editor. I may not name the contributors, the flower of\\nthe young lions, elderly lions now, there is a new race. But one lion, a\\ndistinguished and learned lion, said already that fiction, not essay, was\\nMr. Stevenson\\'s field. Well, both fields were his, and I cannot say\\nwhether I would be more sorry to lose _Virginibus Puerisque_ and \"Studies\\nof Men and Books,\" or \"Treasure Island\" and \"Catriona.\" With the decease\\nof G. B., Pactolus dried up in its mysterious sources, _London_ struggled\\nand disappeared.\\nMr. Stevenson was in town, now and again, at the old Saville Club, in\\nSaville Row, which had the tiniest and blackest of smoking-rooms. Here,\\nor somewhere, he spoke to me of an idea of a tale, a Man who was Two Men.\\nI said \"\\'William Wilson\\' by Edgar Poe,\" and declared that it would never\\ndo. But his \"Brownies,\" in a vision of the night, showed him a central\\nscene, and he wrote \"Jekyll and Hyde.\" My \"friend of these days and of\\nall days,\" Mr. Charles Longman, sent me the manuscript. In a very\\ncommonplace London drawing-room, at 10.30 P.M., I began to read it.\\nArriving at the place where Utterson the lawyer, and the butler wait\\noutside the Doctor\\'s room, I threw down the manuscript and fled in a\\nhurry. I had no taste for solitude any more. The story won its great\\nsuccess, partly by dint of the moral (whatever that may be), more by its\\nterrible, lucid, visionary power. I remember Mr. Stevenson telling me,\\nat this time, that he was doing some \"regular crawlers,\" for this purist\\nhad a boyish habit of slang, and I _think_ it was he who called Julius\\nCaesar \"the howlingest cheese who ever lived.\" One of the \"crawlers\" was\\n\"Thrawn Janet\"; after \"Wandering Willie\\'s Tale\" (but certainly _after_\\nit), to my taste, it seems the most wonderful story of the \"supernatural\"\\nin our language.\\nMr. Stevenson had an infinite pleasure in Boisgobey, Montepin, and, of\\ncourse, Gaboriau. There was nothing of the \"cultured person\" about him.\\nConcerning a novel dear to culture, he said that he would die by my side,\\nin the last ditch, proclaiming it the worst fiction in the world. I make\\nhaste to add that I have only known two men of letters as free as Mr.\\nStevenson, not only from literary jealousy, but from the writer\\'s\\nnatural, if exaggerated, distaste for work which, though in his own line,\\nis very different in aim and method from his own. I do not remember\\nanother case in which he dispraised any book. I do remember his\\nobservations on a novel then and now very popular, but not to his taste,\\nnor, indeed, by any means, impeccable, though stirring; his censure and\\npraise were both just. From his occasional fine efforts, the author of\\nthis romance, he said, should have cleared away acres of brushwood, of\\nineffectual matter. It was so, no doubt, as the writer spoken of would\\nbe ready to acknowledge. But he was an improviser of genius, and Mr.\\nStevenson was a conscious artist.\\nOf course we did by no means always agree in literary estimates; no two\\npeople do. But when certain works--in his line in one way--were stupidly\\nset up as rivals of his, the person who was most irritated was not he,\\nbut his equally magnanimous contemporary. There was no thought of\\nrivalry or competition in either mind. The younger romancists who arose\\nafter Mr. Stevenson went to Samoa were his friends by correspondence;\\nfrom them, who never saw his face, I hear of his sympathy and\\nencouragement. Every writer knows the special temptations of his tribe:\\nthey were temptations not even felt, I do believe, by Mr. Stevenson. His\\nheart was far too high, his nature was in every way as generous as his\\nhand was open. It is in thinking of these things that one feels afresh\\nthe greatness of the world\\'s loss; for \"a good heart is much more than\\nstyle,\" writes one who knew him only by way of letters.\\nIt is a trivial reminiscence that we once plotted a Boisgobesque story\\ntogether. There was a prisoner in a Muscovite dungeon.\\n\"We\\'ll extract information from him,\" I said.\\n\"How?\"\\n\"With corkscrews.\"\\nBut the mere suggestion of such a process was terribly distasteful to\\nhim; not that I really meant to go to these extreme lengths. We never,\\nof course, could really have worked together; and, his maladies\\nincreasing, he became more and more a wanderer, living at Bournemouth, at\\nDavos, in the Grisons, finally, as all know, in Samoa. Thus, though we\\ncorresponded, not unfrequently, I never was of the inner circle of his\\nfriends. Among men there were school or college companions, or\\ncompanions of Paris or Fontainebleau, cousins, like Mr. R. A. M.\\nStevenson, or a stray senior, like Mr. Sidney Colvin. From some of them,\\nor from Mr. Stevenson himself, I have heard tales of \"the wild Prince and\\nPoins.\" That he and a friend travelled utterly without baggage, buying a\\nshirt where a shirt was needed, is a fact, and the incident is used in\\n\"The Wrecker.\" Legend says that once he and a friend _did_ possess a\\nbag, and also, nobody ever knew why, a large bottle of scent. But there\\nwas no room for the bottle in the bag, so Mr. Stevenson spilled the whole\\ncontents over the other man\\'s head, taking him unawares, that nothing\\nmight be wasted. I think the tale of the endless staircase, in \"The\\nWrecker,\" is founded on fact, so are the stories of the _atelier_, which\\nI have heard Mr. Stevenson narrate at the Oxford and Cambridge Club. For\\na nocturnal adventure, in the manner of the \"New Arabian Nights,\" a\\nlearned critic already spoken of must be consulted. It is not my story.\\nIn Paris, at a cafe, I remember that Mr. Stevenson heard a Frenchman say\\nthe English were cowards. He got up and slapped the man\\'s face.\\n\"_Monsieur, vous m\\'avez frappe_!\" said the Gaul.\\n\"_A ce qu\\'il parait_,\" said the Scot, and there it ended. He also told\\nme that years ago he was present at a play, I forget what play, in Paris,\\nwhere the moral hero exposes a woman \"with a history.\" He got up and\\nwent out, saying to himself:\\n\"What a play! what a people!\"\\n\"_Ah, Monsieur, vous etes bien jeune_!\" said an old French gentleman.\\nLike a right Scot, Mr. Stevenson was fond of \"our auld ally of France,\"\\nto whom our country and our exiled kings owed so much.\\nI rather vaguely remember another anecdote. He missed his train from\\nEdinburgh to London, and his sole portable property was a return ticket,\\na meerschaum pipe, and a volume of Mr. Swinburne\\'s poems. The last he\\nfound unmarketable; the pipe, I think, he made merchandise of, but\\nsomehow his provender for the day\\'s journey consisted in one bath bun,\\nwhich he could not finish.\\nThese trivial tales illustrate a period in his life and adventures which\\nI only know by rumour. Our own acquaintance was, to a great degree,\\nliterary and bookish. Perhaps it began \"with a slight aversion,\" but it\\nseemed, like madeira, to be ripened and improved by his long sea voyage;\\nand the news of his death taught me, at least, the true nature of the\\naffection which he was destined to win. Indeed, our acquaintance was\\nlike the friendship of a wild singing bird and of a punctual,\\ndomesticated barn-door fowl, laying its daily \"article\" for the breakfast-\\ntable of the citizens. He often wrote to me from Samoa, sometimes with\\nnews of native manners and folklore. He sent me a devil-box, the \"luck\"\\nof some strange island, which he bought at a great price. After parting\\nwith its \"luck,\" or fetish (a shell in a curious wooden box), the island\\nwas unfortunate, and was ravaged by measles.\\nI occasionally sent out books needed for Mr. Stevenson\\'s studies, of\\nwhich more will be said. But I must make it plain that, in the body, we\\nmet but rarely. His really intimate friends were Mr. Colvin and Mr.\\nBaxter (who managed the practical side of his literary business between\\nthem); Mr. Henley (in partnership with whom he wrote several plays); his\\ncousin, Mr. R. A. M. Stevenson; and, among other _literati_, Mr. Gosse,\\nMr. Austin Dobson, Mr. Saintsbury, Mr Walter Pollock, knew him well. The\\nbest portrait of Mr. Stevenson that I know is by Sir. W. B. Richmond,\\nR.A., and is in that gentleman\\'s collection of contemporaries, with the\\neffigies of Mr. Holman Hunt, Mr. William Morris, Mr. Browning, and\\nothers. It is unfinished, owing to an illness which stopped the\\nsittings, and does not show the subject at his best, physically speaking.\\nThere is also a brilliant, slight sketch, almost a caricature, by Mr.\\nSargent. It represents Mr. Stevenson walking about the room in\\nconversation.\\nThe people I have named, or some of them, knew Mr. Stevenson more\\nintimately than I can boast of doing. Unlike each other, opposites in a\\ndozen ways, we always were united by the love of letters, and of\\nScotland, our dear country. He was a patriot, yet he spoke his mind\\nquite freely about Burns, about that apparent want of heart in the poet\\'s\\namours, which our countrymen do not care to hear mentioned. Well,\\nperhaps, for some reasons, it had to be mentioned once, and so no more of\\nit.\\nMr. Stevenson possessed, more than any man I ever met, the power of\\nmaking other men fall in love with him. I mean that he excited a\\npassionate admiration and affection, so much so that I verily believe\\nsome men were jealous of other men\\'s place in his liking. I once met a\\nstranger who, having become acquainted with him, spoke of him with a\\ntouching fondness and pride, his fancy reposing, as it seemed, in a fond\\ncontemplation of so much genius and charm. What was so taking in him?\\nand how is one to analyse that dazzling surface of pleasantry, that\\nchangeful shining humour, wit, wisdom, recklessness; beneath which beat\\nthe most kind and tolerant of hearts?\\nPeople were fond of him, and people were proud of him: his achievements,\\nas it were, sensibly raised their pleasure in the world, and, to them,\\nbecame parts of themselves. They warmed their hands at that centre of\\nlight and heat. It is not every success which has these beneficent\\nresults. We see the successful sneered at, decried, insulted, even when\\nsuccess is deserved. Very little of all this, hardly aught of all this,\\nI think, came in Mr. Stevenson\\'s way. After the beginning (when the\\npraises of his earliest admirers were irritating to dull scribes) he\\nfound the critics fairly kind, I believe, and often enthusiastic. He was\\nso much his own severest critic that he probably paid little heed to\\nprofessional reviewers. In addition to his \"Rathillet,\" and other MSS.\\nwhich he destroyed, he once, in the Highlands, long ago, lost a\\nportmanteau with a batch of his writings. Alas, that he should have lost\\nor burned anything! \"King\\'s chaff,\" says our country proverb, \"is better\\nthan other folk\\'s corn.\"\\nI have remembered very little, or very little that I can write, and about\\nour last meeting, when he was so near death, in appearance, and so full\\nof courage--how can I speak? His courage was a strong rock, not to be\\ntaken or subdued. When unable to utter a single word, his pencilled\\nremarks to his attendants were pithy and extremely characteristic. This\\ncourage and spiritual vitality made one hope that he would, if he desired\\nit, live as long as Voltaire, that reed among oaks. There were of\\ncourse, in so rare a combination of characteristics, some which were not\\nequally to the liking of all. He was highly original in costume, but, as\\nhis photographs are familiar, the point does not need elucidation. Life\\nwas a drama to him, and he delighted, like his own British admirals, to\\ndo things with a certain air. He observed himself, I used to think, as\\nhe observed others, and \"saw himself\" in every part he played. There was\\nnothing of the _cabotin_ in this self-consciousness; it was the\\nunextinguished childish passion for \"playing at things\" which remained\\nwith him. I have a theory that all children possess genius, and that it\\ndies out in the generality of mortals, abiding only with people whose\\ngenius the world is forced to recognise. Mr. Stevenson illustrates, and\\nperhaps partly suggested, this private philosophy of mine.\\nI have said very little; I have no skill in reminiscences, no art to\\nbring the living aspect of the man before those who never knew him. I\\nfaintly seem to see the eager face, the light nervous figure, the fingers\\nbusy with rolling cigarettes; Mr. Stevenson talking, listening, often\\nrising from his seat, standing, walking to and fro, always full of vivid\\nintelligence, wearing a mysterious smile. I remember one pleasant dark\\nafternoon, when he told me many tales of strange adventures, narratives\\nwhich he had heard about a murderous lonely inn, somewhere in the States.\\nHe was as good to hear as to read. I do not recollect much of that\\ndelight in discussion, in controversy, which he shows in his essay on\\nconversation, where he describes, I believe, Mr. Henley as \"Burley,\" and\\nMr. Symonds as \"Opalstein.\" He had great pleasure in the talk of the\\nlate Professor Fleeming Jenkin, which was both various and copious. But\\nin these _noctes coenaeque deum_ I was never a partaker. In many topics,\\nsuch as angling, golf, cricket, whereon I am willingly diffuse, Mr.\\nStevenson took no interest. He was very fond of boating and sailing in\\nevery kind; he hazarded his health by long expeditions among the fairy\\nisles of ocean, but he \"was not a British sportsman,\" though for his\\nmeasure of strength a good pedestrian, a friend of the open air, and of\\nall who live and toil therein.\\nAs to his literary likings, they appear in his own confessions. He\\nrevelled in Dickens, but, about Thackeray--well, I would rather have\\ntalked to somebody else! To my amazement, he was of those (I think) who\\nfind Thackeray \"cynical.\" \"He takes you into a garden, and then pelts\\nyou with\"--horrid things! Mr. Stevenson, on the other hand, had a free\\nadmiration of Mr. George Meredith. He did not so easily forgive the\\n_longueus_ and lazinesses of Scott, as a Scot should do. He read French\\nmuch; Greek only in translations.\\nLiterature was, of course, his first love, but he was actually an\\nadvocate at the Scottish Bar, and, as such, had his name on a brazen door-\\nplate. Once he was a competitor for a Chair of Modern History in\\nEdinburgh University; he knew the romantic side of Scottish history very\\nwell. In his novel, \"Catriona,\" the character of James Mohr Macgregor is\\nwonderfully divined. Once I read some unpublished letters of Catriona\\'s\\nunworthy father, written when he was selling himself as a spy (and lying\\nas he spied) to the Hanoverian usurper. Mr. Stevenson might have written\\nthese letters for James Mohr; they might be extracts from \"Catriona.\"\\nIn turning over old Jacobite pamphlets, I found a forgotten romance of\\nPrince Charles\\'s hidden years, and longed that Mr. Stevenson should\\nretell it. There was a treasure, an authentic treasure; there were real\\nspies, a real assassin; a real, or reported, rescue of a lovely girl from\\na fire at Strasbourg, by the Prince. The tale was to begin _sur le pont\\nd\\'Avignon_: a young Scotch exile watching the Rhone, thinking how much of\\nit he could cover with a salmon fly, thinking of the Tay or Beauly. To\\nhim enter another shady tramping exile, Blairthwaite, a murderer. And so\\nit was to run on, as the author\\'s fancy might lead him, with Alan Breck\\nand the Master for characters. At last, in unpublished MSS. I found an\\nactual Master of Ballantrae, a Highland chief--noble, majestically\\nhandsome--and a paid spy of England! All these papers I sent out to\\nSamoa, too late. The novel was to have been dedicated to me, and that\\nchance of immortality is gone, with so much else.\\nMr. Stevenson\\'s last letters to myself were full of his concern for a\\ncommon friend of ours, who was very ill. Depressed himself, Mr.\\nStevenson wrote to this gentleman--why should I not mention Mr. James\\nPayn?--with consoling gaiety. I attributed his depression to any cause\\nbut his own health, of which he rarely spoke. He lamented the\\n\"ill-staged fifth act of life\"; he, at least, had no long hopeless years\\nof diminished force to bear.\\nI have known no man in whom the pre-eminently manly virtues of kindness,\\ncourage, sympathy, generosity, helpfulness, were more beautifully\\nconspicuous than in Mr. Stevenson, no man so much loved--it is not too\\nstrong a word--by so many and such various people. He was as unique in\\ncharacter as in literary genius.\\nCHAPTER III: RAB\\'S FRIEND\\nTo say what ought to be said concerning Dr. John Brown, a man should have\\nknown him well and long, and should remember much of that old generation\\nof Scotchmen to whom the author of \"Rab and his Friends\" belonged. But\\nthat generation has departed. One by one these wits and scholars of the\\nNorth, these _epigoni_ who were not, indeed, of the heroes, but who had\\nseen and remembered Scott and Wilson, have passed away. Aytoun and\\nCarlyle and Dr. Burton, and last, Dr. Brown, are gone. Sir Theodore\\nMartin alone is left. In her memoir of Dr. Burton--the historian of\\nScotland, and author of \"The Book-hunter\"--Mrs. Burton remarks that, in\\nher husband\\'s later days, only Dr. John Brown and Professor Blackie\\nremained of all her husband\\'s ancient friends and coevals, of all who\\nremembered Lockhart, and Hogg, and their times. But many are left who\\nknew Dr. Brown far better and more intimately than the author of this\\nnotice. I can hardly say when I first became acquainted with him,\\nprobably it was in my childhood. Ever since I was a boy, certainly, I\\nused to see him at intervals, especially in the Christmas vacations. But\\nhe seldom moved from Edinburgh, except in summer, which he frequently\\npassed in the country house of certain friends of his, whose affection\\nmade much of the happiness of his latest years, and whose unfailing\\nkindness attended him in his dying hours. Living always in Scotland, Dr.\\nBrown was seen but rarely by his friends who resided in England. Thus,\\nthough Dr. Brown\\'s sweetness of disposition and charm of manner, his\\nhumour, and his unfailing sympathy and encouragement, made one feel\\ntoward him as to a familiar friend, yet, of his actual life I saw but\\nlittle, and have few reminiscences to contribute. One can only speak of\\nthat singular geniality of his, that temper of goodness and natural\\ntolerance and affection, which, as Scotsmen best know, is not universal\\namong the Scots. Our race does not need to pray, like the mechanic in\\nthe story, that Providence will give us \"a good conceit of ourselves.\"\\nBut we must acknowledge that the Scotch temper is critical if not\\ncaptious, argumentative, inclined to look at the seamy side of men and of\\ntheir performances, and to dwell on imperfections rather than on merits\\nand virtues. An example of these blemishes of the Scotch disposition,\\ncarried to an extreme degree in the nature of a man of genius, is offered\\nto the world in the writings and \"Reminiscences\" of Mr. Carlyle.\\nNow, Dr. John Brown was at the opposite pole of feeling. He had no\\nmawkish toleration of things and people intolerable, but he preferred not\\nto turn his mind that way. His thoughts were with the good, the wise,\\nthe modest, the learned, the brave of times past, and he was eager to\\ncatch a reflection of their qualities in the characters of the living, of\\nall with whom he came into contact. He was, for example, almost\\noptimistic in his estimate of the work of young people in art or\\nliterature. From everything that was beautiful or good, from a summer\\nday by the Tweed, or from the eyes of a child, or from the humorous\\nsaying of a friend, or from treasured memories of old Scotch worthies,\\nfrom recollections of his own childhood, from experience of the stoical\\nheroism of the poor, he seemed to extract matter for pleasant thoughts of\\nmen and the world, and nourishment for his own great and gentle nature. I\\nhave never known any man to whom other men seemed so dear--men dead, and\\nmen living. He gave his genius to knowing them, and to making them\\nbetter known, and his unselfishness thus became not only a great personal\\nvirtue, but a great literary charm. When you met him, he had some \"good\\nstory\" or some story of goodness to tell--for both came alike to him, and\\nhis humour was as unfailing as his kindness. There was in his face a\\nsingular charm, blended, as it were, of the expressions of mirth and of\\npatience. Being most sensitive to pain, as well as to pleasure, he was\\nan exception to that rule of Rochefoucauld\\'s--\"_nous avons tous assez de\\nforce pour supporter les maux d\\'autrui_.\" {2}\\nHe did not bear easily the misfortunes of others, and the evils of his\\nown lot were heavy enough. They saddened him; but neither illness, nor\\nhis poignant anxiety for others, could sour a nature so unselfish. He\\nappeared not to have lost that anodyne and consolation of religious hope,\\nwhich had been the strength of his forefathers, and was his best\\ninheritance from a remarkable race of Scotsmen. Wherever he came, he was\\nwelcome; people felt glad when they had encountered him in the\\nstreets--the streets of Edinburgh, where almost every one knows every one\\nby sight--and he was at least as joyously received by the children and\\nthe dogs as by the grown-up people of every family. A friend has kindly\\nshown me a letter in which it is told how Dr. Brown\\'s love of dogs, his\\ninterest in a half-blind old Dandy which was attached to him, was evinced\\nin the very last hours of his life. But enough has been said, in general\\nterms, about the character of \"the beloved physician,\" as Dr. Brown was\\ncalled in Edinburgh, and a brief account may be given, in some detail, of\\nhis life and ways.\\nDr. John Brown was born in Biggar, one of the gray, slaty-looking little\\ntowns in the pastoral moorlands of southern Scotland. These towns have\\nno great beauty that they should be admired by strangers, but the\\nnatives, as Scott said to Washington Irving, are attached to their \"gray\\nhills,\" and to the Tweed, so beautiful where man\\'s greed does not pollute\\nit, that the Border people are all in love with it, as Tyro, in Homer,\\nloved the divine Enipeus. We hold it \"far the fairest of the floods that\\nrun upon the earth.\" How dear the border scenery was to Dr. John Brown,\\nand how well he knew and could express its legendary magic, its charm\\nwoven of countless ancient spells, the music of old ballads, the sorcery\\nof old stories, may be understood by readers of his essay on \"Minchmoor.\"\\n{3} The father of Dr. Brown was the third in a lineage of ministers of\\nthe sect called Seceders. To explain who the Seceders were, it would be\\nnecessary to explore the sinking morasses of Scotch ecclesiastical\\nhistory. The minister was proud of being not only a \"Seceder\" but a\\n\"Burgher.\" He inherited, to be brief, the traditions of a most\\nspiritually-minded and most spirited set of men, too much bent, it may\\nappear to us, on establishing delicate distinctions of opinions, but\\ncertainly most true to themselves and to their own ideals of liberty and\\nof faith. Dr. Brown\\'s great-grandfather had been a shepherd boy, who\\ntaught himself Greek that he might read the New Testament; who walked\\ntwenty-four miles--leaving his folded sheep in the night--to buy the\\nprecious volume in St. Andrews, and who, finally, became a teacher of\\nmuch repute among his own people. Of Dr. Brown\\'s father, he himself\\nwrote a most touching and beautiful account in his \"Letter to John\\nCairns, D.D.\" This essay contains, perhaps, the very finest passages\\nthat the author ever penned. His sayings about his own childhood remind\\none of the manner of Lamb, without that curious fantastic touch which is\\nof the essence of Lamb\\'s style. The following lines, for example, are a\\nrevelation of childish psychology, and probably may be applied, with\\nalmost as much truth, to the childhood of our race:--\\n \"Children are long of seeing, or at least of looking at what is above\\n them; they like the ground, and its flowers and stones, its \\'red\\n sodgers\\' and lady-birds, and all its queer things; _their world is\\n about three feet high_, and they are more often stooping than gazing\\n up. I know I was past ten before I saw, or cared to see, the ceilings\\n of the rooms in the manse at Biggar.\"\\nI have often thought that the earliest fathers of our race, child-like in\\nso many ways, were child-like in this, and worshipped, not the phenomena\\nof the heavens, but objects more on a level with their eyes--the \"queer\\nthings\" of their low-lying world. In this essay on his father, Dr. Brown\\nhas written lines about a child\\'s first knowledge of death, which seem as\\nnoteworthy as Steele\\'s famous passage about his father\\'s death and his\\nown half-conscious grief and anger. Dr. Brown describes a Scottish\\nfuneral--the funeral of his own mother--as he saw it with the eyes of a\\nboy of five years old, while his younger brother, a baby of a few months--\\n \"leaped up and crowed with joy at the strange sight--the crowding\\n horsemen, the coaches, and the nodding plumes of the hearse . . .\\n Then, to my surprise and alarm, the coffin, resting on its bearers,\\n was placed over the dark hole, and I watched with curious eye the\\n unrolling of those neat black bunches of cords, which I have often\\n enough seen since. My father took the one at the head, and also\\n another much smaller, springing from the same point as his, which he\\n had caused to be placed there, and unrolling it, put it into my hand.\\n I twisted it firmly round my fingers, and awaited the result; the\\n burial men with their real ropes lowered the coffin, and when it\\n rested at the bottom it was too far down for me to see it. The grave\\n was made very deep, as he used afterwards to tell us, that it might\\n hold us all. My father first and abruptly let his cord drop, followed\\n by the rest. This was too much. I now saw what was meant, and held\\n on and fixed my fist and feet, and I believe my father had some\\n difficulty in forcing open my small fingers; he let the little black\\n cord drop, and I remember, in my misery and anger, seeing its open end\\n disappearing in the gloom.\" {4}\\nThe man who wrote this, and many another passage as true and tender,\\nmight surely have been famous in fiction, if he had turned his powers\\nthat way. He had imagination, humour, pathos; he was always studying and\\nobserving life; his last volume, especially, is like a collection of\\nfragments that might have gone toward making a work, in some ways not\\ninferior to the romances of Scott. When the third volume of Essays was\\npublished, in the spring of his last year, a reviewer, who apparently had\\nno personal knowledge of Dr. Brown, asked why he did not write a novel.\\nHe was by that time over seventy years of age, and, though none guessed\\nit, within a few weeks of his death. What he might have done, had he\\ngiven himself to literature only, it is impossible to guess. But he\\ncaused so much happiness, and did so much good, in that gentle profession\\nof healing which he chose, and which brought him near to many who needed\\nconsolation more than physic, that we need not forget his deliberate\\nchoice. Literature had only his _horae subsecivae_, as he said:\\n_Subseciva quaedam tempora quae ego perire non patior_, as Cicero writes,\\n\"shreds and waste ends of time, which I suffer not to be lost.\"\\nThe kind of life which Dr. Brown\\'s father and his people lived at Biggar,\\nthe austere life of work, and of thought intensely bent on the real aim\\nof existence, on God, on the destiny of the soul, is perhaps rare now,\\neven in rural Scotland. We are less obedient than of old to the motto of\\nthat ring found on Magus Moor, where Archbishop Shairp was murdered,\\n_Remember upon Dethe_. If any reader has not yet made the acquaintance\\nof Dr. Brown\\'s works, one might counsel him to begin with the \"Letter to\\nJohn Cairns, D.D.,\" the fragment of biography and autobiography, the\\ndescription of the fountainheads from which the genius of the author\\nflowed. In his early boyhood, John Brown was educated by his father, a\\nman who, from his son\\'s affectionate description, seems to have confined\\na fiery and romantic genius within the channels of Seceder and Burgher\\ntheology. When the father received a call to the \"Rose Street Secession\\nChurch,\" in Edinburgh, the son became a pupil of that ancient Scottish\\nseminary, the High School--the school where Scott was taught not much\\nLatin and no Greek worth mentioning. Scott was still alive and strong in\\nthose days, and Dr. Brown describes how he and his school companions\\nwould take off their hats to the Shirra as he passed in the streets.\\n\"Though lame, he was nimble, and all rough and alive with power; had you\\nmet him anywhere else, you would say he was a Liddesdale store farmer,\\ncome of gentle blood--\\'a stout, blunt carle,\\' as he says of himself, with\\nthe swing and stride and the eye of a man of the hills--a large, sunny,\\nout-of-door air all about him. On his broad and stooping shoulders was\\nset that head which, with Shakespeare\\'s and Bonaparte\\'s, is the best\\nknown in all the world.\" Scott was then living in 39 Castle Street. I\\ndo not know whether the many pilgrims, whom one meets moving constantly\\nin the direction of Melrose and Abbotsford, have thought of making\\npilgrimage to Castle Street, and to the grave, there, of Scott\\'s \"dear\\nold friend,\"--his dog Camp. Of Dr. Brown\\'s schoolboy days, one knows\\nlittle--days when \"Bob Ainslie and I were coming up Infirmary Street from\\nthe High School, our heads together, and our arms intertwisted, as only\\nlovers and boys know how or why.\" Concerning the doctor\\'s character, he\\nhas left it on record that he liked a dog-fight. \"\\'A dog-fight,\\' shouted\\nBob, and was off, and so was I, both of us all hot, praying that it might\\nnot be over before we were up . . . Dogs like fighting; old Isaac (Watts,\\nnot Walton) says they \\'delight\\' in it, and for the best of all reasons;\\nand boys are not cruel because they like to see the fight. This is a\\nvery different thing from a love of making dogs fight.\" And this was the\\nmost famous of all dog-fights--since the old Irish Brehons settled the\\nlaws of that sport, and gravely decided what was to be done if a child\\ninterfered, or an idiot, or a woman, or a one-eyed man--for this was the\\ndog-fight in which Rab first was introduced to his historian.\\nSix years passed after this battle, and Dr. Brown was a medical student\\nand a clerk at Minto Hospital. How he renewed his acquaintance there,\\nand in what sad circumstances, with Rab and his friends, it is\\nsuperfluous to tell, for every one who reads at all has read that story,\\nand most readers not without tears. As a medical student in Edinburgh,\\nDr. Brown made the friendship of Mr. Syme, the famous surgeon--a\\nfriendship only closed by death. I only saw them once together, a very\\nlong time ago, and then from the point of view of a patient. These\\noccasions are not agreeable, and patients, like the old cock which did\\nnot crow when plucked, are apt to be \"very much absorbed\"; but Dr.\\nBrown\\'s attitude toward the man whom he regarded with the reverence of a\\ndisciple, as well as with the affection of a friend, was very remarkable.\\nWhen his studies were over, Dr. Brown practised for a year as assistant\\nto a surgeon in Chatham. It must have been when he was at Chatham that a\\ncurious event occurred. Many years later, Charles Dickens was in\\nEdinburgh, reading his stories in public, and was dining with some\\nEdinburgh people. Dickens began to speak about the panic which the\\ncholera had caused in England: how ill some people had behaved. As a\\ncontrast, he mentioned that, at Chatham, one poor woman had died,\\ndeserted by every one except a young physician. Some one, however,\\nventured to open the door, and found the woman dead, and the young doctor\\nasleep, overcome with the fatigue that mastered him on his patient\\'s\\ndeath, but quite untouched by the general panic. \"Why, that was Dr. John\\nBrown,\" one of the guests observed; and it seems that, thus early in his\\ncareer, the doctor had been setting an example of the courage and charity\\nof his profession. After a year spent in Chatham, he returned to\\nEdinburgh, where he spent the rest of his life, busy partly with his art\\nof healing, partly with literature. He lived in Rutland Street, near the\\nrailway station, by which Edinburgh is approached from the west, and\\nclose to Princes Street, the chief street of the town, separated by a\\ngreen valley, once a loch, from the high Castle Rock. It was the room in\\nwhich his friends were accustomed to see Dr. Brown, and a room full of\\ninterest it was. In his long life, the doctor had gathered round him\\nmany curious relics of artists and men of letters; a drawing of a dog by\\nTurner I remember particularly, and a copy of \"Don Juan,\" in the first\\nedition, with Byron\\'s manuscript notes. Dr. Brown had a great love and\\nknowledge of art and of artists, from Turner to Leech; and he had very\\nmany friends among men of letters, such as Mr. Ruskin and Mr. Thackeray.\\nDr. Brown himself was a clever designer of rapid little grotesques, rough\\nsketches of dogs and men. One or two of them are engraved in the little\\npaper-covered booklets in which some of his essays were separately\\npublished--booklets which he was used to present to people who came to\\nsee him and who were interested in all that he did. I remember some\\nvivacious grotesques which he drew for one of my brothers when we were\\nschoolboys. These little things were carefully treasured by boys who\\nknew Dr. Brown, and found him friendly, and capable of sustaining a\\nconversation on the points of a Dandy Dinmont terrier and other mysteries\\nimportant to youth. He was a bibliophile--a taste which he inherited\\nfrom his father, who \"began collecting books when he was twelve, and was\\ncollecting to his last hours.\"\\nThe last time I ever saw Dr. Brown, a year before his death, he was kind\\nenough to lend me one of the rarest of his treasures, \"Poems,\" by Mr.\\nRuskin. Probably Mr. Ruskin had presented the book to his old friend; in\\nno other way were it easy to procure writings which the author withdrew\\nfrom publication, if, indeed, they ever were, properly speaking,\\npublished. Thus Dr. Brown was all things to all men, and to all boys. He\\n\"had a word for every one,\" as poor people say, and a word to the point,\\nfor he was as much at home with the shepherd on the hills, or with the\\nangler between Hollylea and Clovenfords, as with the dusty book-hunter,\\nor the doggy young Border yeoman, or the child who asked him to \"draw her\\na picture,\" or the friend of genius famous through all the world,\\nThackeray, when he \"spoke, as he seldom did, of divine things.\"\\nThree volumes of essays are all that Dr. Brown has left in the way of\\ncompositions: a light, but imperishable literary baggage. His studies\\nare usually derived from personal experience, which he reproduced with\\nsingular geniality and simplicity, or they are drawn from the tradition\\nof the elders, the reminiscences of long-lived Scotch people, who,\\nthemselves, had listened attentively to those who went before them. Since\\nScott, these ancient ladies with wonderful memories have had no such\\nattentive listener or appreciative reporter as Dr. Brown. His paper\\ncalled \"Mystifications,\" a narrative of the pranks of Miss Stirling\\nGraham, is a brief, vivid record of the clever and quaint society of\\nScotland sixty years ago. Scotland, or at least Scottish society, is now\\nonly English society--a little narrower, a little prouder, sometimes even\\na little duller. But old people of position spoke the old Scotch tongue\\nsixty years ago, and were full of wonderful genealogies, full of\\nreminiscences of the \"\\'45,\" and the adventures of the Jacobites. The\\nvery last echoes of that ancient world are dying now from memory, like\\nthe wide reverberations of that gun which Miss Nelly MacWilliam heard on\\nthe day when Prince Charles landed, and which resounded strangely all\\nthrough Scotland.\\nThe children of this generation, one fears, will hardly hear of these old\\nraids and duels, risings and rebellions, by oral tradition handed down,\\nunbroken, through aunts and grandmothers. Scott reaped a full, late\\nharvest of the memories of clannish and feudal Scotland; Dr. Brown came\\nas a later gleaner, and gathered these stirring tales of \"A Jacobite\\nFamily\" which are published in the last volume of his essays. When he\\nwas an observer, not a hearer only, Dr. Brown chiefly studied and best\\nwrote of the following topics: passages and characters of humour and\\npathos which he encountered in his life and profession; children, dogs,\\nBorder scenery, and fellow-workers in life and science. Under one or\\nother of these categories all his best compositions might be arranged.\\nThe most famous and most exquisite of all his works in the first class is\\nthe unrivalled \"Rab and his Friends\"--a study of the stoicism and\\ntenderness of the Lowland character worthy of Scott. In a minor way the\\nlittle paper on \"Jeems,\" the door-keeper in a Dissenting house of the\\nLord, is interesting to Scotch people, though it must seem a rather\\ncurious revelation to all others. \"Her last Half-crown\" is another study\\nof the honesty that survived in a starving and outcast Scotch girl, when\\nall other virtues, as we commonly reckon virtue, had gone before her\\ncharacter to some place where, let us hope, they may rejoin her; for if\\nwe are to suffer for the vices which have abandoned us, may we not get\\nsome credit for the virtues that we have abandoned, but that once were\\nours, in some heaven paved with bad resolutions unfulfilled? \"The Black\\nDwarf\\'s Bones\" is a sketch of the misshapen creature from whom Scott\\nborrowed the character that gives a name to one of his minor Border\\nstories. The real Black Dwarf (David Ritchie he was called among men)\\nwas fond of poetry, but hated Burns. He was polite to the fair, but\\nclassed mankind at large with his favourite aversions: ghosts, fairies,\\nand robbers. There was this of human about the Black Dwarf, that \"he\\nhated folk that are aye gaun to dee, and never do\\'t.\" The village\\nbeauties were wont to come to him for a Judgment of Paris on their\\ncharms, and he presented each with a flower, which was of a fixed value\\nin his standard of things beautiful. One kind of rose, the prize of the\\nmost fair, he only gave thrice. Paris could not have done his dooms more\\ncourteously, and, if he had but made judicious use of rose, lily, and\\nlotus, as prizes, he might have pleased all the three Goddesses; Troy\\nstill might be standing, and the lofty house of King Priam.\\nAmong Dr. Brown\\'s papers on children, that called \"Pet Marjorie\" holds\\nthe highest place. Perhaps certain passages are \"wrote too\\nsentimentally,\" as Marjorie Fleming herself remarked about the practice\\nof many authors. But it was difficult to be perfectly composed when\\nspeaking of this wonderful fairy-like little girl, whose affection was as\\nwarm as her humour and genius were precocious. \"Infant phenomena\" are\\nseldom agreeable, but Marjorie was so humorous, so quick-tempered, so\\nkind, that we cease to regard her as an intellectual \"phenomenon.\" Her\\nmemory remains sweet and blossoming in its dust, like that of little\\nPenelope Boothby, the child in the mob cap whom Sir Joshua painted, and\\nwho died very soon after she was thus made Immortal.\\nIt is superfluous to quote from the essay on Marjorie Fleming; every one\\nknows about her and her studies: \"Isabella is teaching me to make simme\\ncolings, nots of interrigations, peorids, commoes, &c.\" Here is a\\nShakespearian criticism, of which few will deny the correctness:\\n\"\\'Macbeth\\' is a pretty composition, but awful one.\" Again, \"I never read\\nsermons of any kind, but I read novelettes and my Bible.\" \"\\'Tom Jones\\'\\nand Gray\\'s \\'Elegy in a Country Churchyard\\' are both excellent, and much\\nspoke of by both sex, particularly by the men.\" Her Calvinistic belief\\nin \"_unquestionable_ fire and brimston\" is unhesitating, but the young\\ntheologian appears to have substituted \"unquestionable\" for\\n\"unquenchable.\" There is something humorous in the alteration, as if\\nMarjorie refused to be put off with an \"excellent family substitute\" for\\nfire and brimstone, and demanded the \"unquestionable\" article, no other\\nbeing genuine, please observe trade mark.\\nAmong Dr. Brown\\'s contributions to the humorous study of dogs, \"Rab,\" of\\ncourse, holds the same place as Marjorie among his sketches of children.\\nBut if his \"Queen Mary\\'s Child Garden,\" the description of the little\\ngarden in which Mary Stuart did _not_ play when a child, is second to\\n\"Marjorie,\" so \"Our Dogs\" is a good second to \"Rab.\" Perhaps Dr. Brown\\nnever wrote anything more mirthful than his description of the sudden\\nbirth of the virtue of courage in Toby, a comic but cowardly mongrel, a\\ncur of low degree.\\n \"Toby was in the way of hiding his culinary bones in the small gardens\\n before his own and the neighbouring doors. Mr. Scrymgeour, two doors\\n off, a bulky, choleric, red-faced man--_torvo vultu_--was, by law of\\n contrast, a great cultivator of flowers, and he had often scowled Toby\\n into all but non-existence by a stamp of his foot and a glare of his\\n eye. One day, his gate being open, in walks Toby with a huge bone,\\n and making a hole where Scrymgeour had two minutes before been\\n planting some precious slip, the name of which on paper and on a stick\\n Toby made very light of, substituted his bone, and was engaged\\n covering it, or thinking he was covering it up with his shovelling\\n nose, when S. spied him through the inner glass door, and was out upon\\n him, like the Assyrian, with a terrific _gowl_. I watched them.\\n Instantly Toby made at him with a roar too, and an eye more torve than\\n Scrymgeour\\'s, who, retreating without reserve, fell prostrate, there\\n is reason to believe, in his own lobby. Toby contented himself with\\n proclaiming his victory at the door, and, returning, finished his bone-\\n planting at his leisure; the enemy, who had scuttled behind the glass\\n door, glared at him. From this moment Toby was an altered dog. Pluck\\n at first sight was lord of all . . . That very evening he paid a visit\\n to Leo, next door\\'s dog, a big tyrannical bully and coward . . . To\\n him Toby paid a visit that very evening, down into his den, and walked\\n about, as much as to say, \\'Come on, Macduff\\'; but Macduff did not come\\n on.\"\\nThis story is one of the most amazing examples of instant change of\\ncharacter on record, and disproves the sceptical remark that \"no one was\\never converted, except prize-fighters, and colonels in the army.\" I am\\nsorry to say that Dr. Brown was too fond of dogs to be very much attached\\nto cats. I never heard him say anything against cats, or, indeed,\\nagainst anybody; but there are passages in his writings which tend to\\nshow that, when young and thoughtless, he was not far from regarding cats\\nas \"the higher vermin.\" He tells a story of a Ghazi puss, so to speak, a\\nvictorious cat, which, entrenched in a drain, defeated three dogs with\\nsevere loss, and finally escaped unharmed from her enemies. Dr. Brown\\'s\\nfamily gloried in the possession of a Dandy Dinmont named John Pym, whose\\ncousin (Auld Pepper) belonged to one of my brothers. Dr. Brown was much\\ninterested in Pepper, a dog whose family pride was only matched by that\\nof the mother of Candide, and, at one time, threatened to result in the\\nextinction of this branch of the House of Pepper. Dr. Brown had\\nremarked, and my own observations confirm it, that when a Dandy is not\\ngame, his apparent lack of courage arises \"from kindness of heart.\"\\nAmong Dr. Brown\\'s landscapes, as one may call his descriptions of\\nscenery, and of the ancient historical associations with Scotch scenery,\\n\"Minchmoor\" is the most important. He had always been a great lover of\\nthe Tweed. The walk which he commemorates in \"Minchmoor\" was taken, if I\\nam not mistaken, in company with Principal Shairp, Professor of Poetry in\\nthe University of Oxford, and author of one of the most beautiful of\\nTweedside songs, a modern \"Bush aboon Traquair:\"--\\n \"And what saw ye there,\\n At the bush aboon Traquair;\\n Or what did ye hear that was worth your heed?\\n I heard the cushie croon\\n Thro\\' the gowden afternoon,\\n And the Quair burn singing doon to the vale o\\' Tweed.\"\\nThere is in the country of Scott no pleasanter walk than that which Dr.\\nBrown took in the summer afternoon. Within a few miles, many places\\nfamous in history and ballad may be visited: the road by which Montrose\\'s\\nmen fled from Philiphaugh fight; Traquair House, with the bears on its\\ngates, as on the portals of the Baron of Bradwardine; Williamhope, where\\nScott and Mungo Park, the African explorer, parted and went their several\\nways. From the crest of the road you see all the Border hills, the\\nMaiden Paps, the Eildons cloven in three, the Dunion, the Windburg, and\\nso to the distant Cheviots, and Smailholm Tower, where Scott lay when a\\nchild, and clapped his hands at the flashes of the lightning, _haud sine\\nDis animosus infans_, like Horace.\\nFrom the crest of the hill you follow Dr. Brown into the valley of\\nYarrow, and the deep black pools, now called the \"dowie dens,\" and so,\\n\"through the pomp of cultivated nature,\" as Wordsworth says, to the\\nrailway at Selkirk, passing the plain where Janet won back Tamlane from\\nthe queen of the fairies. All this country was familiar to Dr. Brown,\\nand on one of the last occasions when I met him, he was living at\\nHollylea, on the Tweed, just above Ashestiel, Scott\\'s home while he was\\nhappy and prosperous, before he had the unhappy thought of building\\nAbbotsford. At the time I speak of, Dr. Brown had long ceased to write,\\nand his health suffered from attacks of melancholy, in which the world\\nseemed very dark to him. I have been allowed to read some letters which\\nhe wrote in one of these intervals of depression. With his habitual\\nunselfishness, he kept his melancholy to himself, and, though he did not\\ncare for society at such times, he said nothing of his own condition that\\ncould distress his correspondent. In the last year of his life,\\neverything around him seemed to brighten: he was unusually well, he even\\nreturned to his literary work, and saw his last volume of collected\\nessays through the press. They were most favourably received, and the\\nlast letters which I had from him spoke of the pleasure which this\\nsuccess gave him. Three editions of his book (\"John Leech, and Other\\nEssays\") were published in some six weeks. All seemed to go well, and\\none might even have hoped that, with renewed strength, he would take up\\nhis pen again. But his strength was less than we had hoped. A cold\\nsettled on his lungs, and, in spite of the most affectionate nursing, he\\ngrew rapidly weaker. He had little suffering at the end, and his mind\\nremained unclouded. No man of letters could be more widely regretted,\\nfor he was the friend of all who read his books, as, even to people who\\nonly met him once or twice in life, he seemed to become dear and\\nfamiliar.\\nIn one of his very latest writings, \"On Thackeray\\'s Death,\" Dr. Brown\\ntold people (what some of them needed, and still need to be told) how\\ngood, kind, and thoughtful for others was our great writer--our greatest\\nmaster of fiction, I venture to think, since Scott. Some of the lines\\nDr. Brown wrote of Thackerary might be applied to himself: \"He looked\\nalways fresh, with that abounding silvery hair, and his young, almost\\ninfantile face\"--a face very pale, and yet radiant, in his last years,\\nand mildly lit up with eyes full of kindness, and softened by sorrow. In\\nhis last year, Mr. Swinburne wrote to Dr. Brown this sonnet, in which\\nthere seems something of the poet\\'s prophetic gift, and a voice sounds as\\nof a welcome home:--\\n \"Beyond the north wind lay the land of old,\\n Where men dwelt blithe and blameless, clothed and fed\\n With joy\\'s bright raiment, and with love\\'s sweet bread,--\\n The whitest flock of earth\\'s maternal fold,\\n None there might wear about his brows enrolled\\n A light of lovelier fame than rings your head,\\n Whose lovesome love of children and the dead\\n All men give thanks for; I, far off, behold\\n A dear dead hand that links us, and a light\\n The blithest and benignest of the night,--\\n The night of death\\'s sweet sleep, wherein may be\\n A star to show your spirit in present sight\\n Some happier isle in the Elysian sea\\n Where Rab may lick the hand of Marjorie.\"\\nCHAPTER IV: OLIVER WENDELL HOLMES\\nNever but once did I enjoy the privilege of meeting the author of \"Elsie\\nVenner\"--Oliver Wendell Holmes. It was at a dinner given by Mr. Lowell,\\nand of conversation with Dr. Holmes I had very little. He struck me as\\nbeing wonderfully erect, active, and vivacious for his great age. He\\nspoke (perhaps I should not chronicle this impression)--he spoke much,\\nand freely, but rather as if he were wound up to speak, so to say--wound\\nup, I mean, by a sense of duty to himself and kindness to strangers, who\\nwere naturally curious about so well-known a man. In his aspect there\\nwas a certain dryness, and, altogether, his vivacity, his ceaselessness,\\nand a kind of equability of tone in his voice, reminded me of what Homer\\nsays concerning the old men around Priam, above the gate of Troy, how\\nthey \"chirped like cicalas on a summer day.\" About the matter of his\\ntalk I remember nothing, only the manner remains with me, and mine may\\nhave been a false impression, or the manner may have been accidental, and\\nof the moment: or, again, a manner appropriate for conversation with\\nstrangers, each coming up one after the other, to view respectfully so\\ngreat a lion. Among his friends and intimates he was probably a\\ndifferent man, with a tone other and more reposeful.\\nHe had a long, weary task before him, then, to talk his way, ever\\ncourteous, alert, attentive, through part of a London season. Yet, when\\nit was all over, he seems to have enjoyed it, being a man who took\\npleasure in most sorts of experience. He did not affect me, for that one\\ntime, with such a sense of pleasure as Mr. Lowell did--Mr. Lowell, whom I\\nknew so much better, and who was so big, strong, humorous, kind, learned,\\nfriendly, and delightfully natural.\\nDr. Holmes, too, was a delightful companion, and I have merely tried to\\nmake a sort of photographic \"snap-shot\" at him, in a single casual\\nmoment, one of myriads of such moments. Turning to Dr. Holmes\\'s popular,\\nas distinct from his professional writings, one is reminded, as one often\\nis, of the change which seems to come over some books as the reader grows\\nolder. Many books are to one now what they always were; some, like the\\nWaverley novels and Shakespeare, grow better on every fresh reading.\\nThere are books which filled me, in boyhood or in youth, with a sort of\\nadmiring rapture, and a delighted wonder at their novelty, their\\nstrangeness, freshness, greatness. Thus Homer, and the best novels of\\nThackeray, and of Fielding, the plays of Moliere and Shakespeare, the\\npoems of--well, of all the real poets, moved this astonishment of\\nadmiration, and being read again, they move it still. On a different\\nlevel, one may say as much about books so unlike each other, as those of\\nPoe and of Sir Thomas Browne, of Swift and of Charles Lamb.\\nThere are, again, other books which caused this happy emotion of wonder,\\nwhen first perused, long since, but which do so no longer. I am not much\\nsurprised to find Charles Kingsley\\'s novels among them.\\nIn the case of Dr. Holmes\\'s books, I am very sensible of this\\ndisenchanting effect of time and experience. \"The Professor at the\\nBreakfast Table\" and the novels came into my hands when I was very young,\\nin \"green, unknowing youth.\" They seemed extraordinary, new, fantasies\\nof wisdom and wit; the reflections were such as surprised me by their\\ndepth, the illustrations dazzled by their novelty and brilliance.\\nProbably they will still be as fortunate with young readers, and I am to\\nbe pitied, I hope, rather than blamed, if I cannot, like the wise thrush--\\n \"Recapture\\n The first fine careless rapture.\"\\nBy this time, of course, one understands many of the constituents of Dr.\\nHolmes\\'s genius, the social, historical, ancestral, and professional\\nelements thereof. Now, it is the business of criticism to search out and\\nillustrate these antecedents, and it seems a very odd and unlucky thing,\\nthat the results of this knowledge when acquired, should sometimes be a\\npartial disenchantment. But we are not disenchanted at all by this kind\\nof science, when the author whom we are examining is a great natural\\ngenius, like Shakespeare or Shelley, Keats or Scott. Such natures bring\\nto the world far more than they receive, as far as our means of knowing\\nwhat they receive are concerned. The wind of the spirit that is not of\\nthis earth, nor limited by time and space, breathes through their words,\\nand thoughts, and deeds. They are not mere combinations, however deft\\nand subtle, of _known_ atoms. They must continually delight, and\\ncontinually surprise; custom cannot stale them; like the heaven-born Laws\\nin Sophocles, age can never lull them to sleep. Their works, when they\\nare authors, never lose hold on our fancy and our interest.\\nAs far as my own feelings and admiration can inform me, Dr. Holmes,\\nthough a most interesting and amiable and kindly man and writer, was not\\nof this class. As an essayist, a delineator of men and morals, an\\nunassuming philosopher, with a light, friendly wit, he certainly does not\\nhold one as, for example, Addison does. The old _Spectator_ makes me\\nsmile, pleases, tickles, diverts me now, even more than when I lay on the\\ngrass and read it by Tweedside, as a boy, when the trout were sluggish,\\nin the early afternoon. It is only a personal fact that Dr. Holmes, read\\nin the same old seasons, with so much pleasure and admiration and\\nsurprise, no longer affects me in the old way. Carlyle, on the other\\nhand, in his \"Frederick,\" which used to seem rather long, now entertains\\nme far more than ever. But I am well aware that this is a mere\\nsubjective estimate; that Dr. Holmes may really be as great a genius as I\\nwas wont to think him, for criticism is only a part of our impressions.\\nThe opinion of mature experience, as a rule, ought to be sounder than\\nthat of youth; in this case I cannot but think that it is sounder.\\nDr. Holmes was a New Englander, and born in what he calls \"the Brahmin\\ncaste,\" the class which, in England, before the sailing of the _May\\nFlower_, and ever since, had always been literary and highly educated. \"I\\nlike books; I was born and bred among them,\" he says, \"and have the easy\\nfeeling, when I get into their presence, that a stable-boy has among\\nhorses.\" He is fond of books, and, above all, of old books--strange, old\\nmedical works, for example--full of portents and prodigies, such as those\\nof Wierus.\\nNew England, owing to its famous college, Harvard, and its steady\\nmaintenance of the literary and learned tradition among the clergy, was,\\nnaturally, the home of the earliest great American school of writers.\\nThese men--Longfellow, Lowell, Ticknor, Prescott, Hawthorne, and so many\\nothers--had all received the same sort of education as Europeans of\\nletters used to receive. They had not started as printers\\' devils, or\\nnewspaper reporters, or playwrights for the stage, but were academic. It\\ndoes not matter much how a genius begins--as a rural butcher, or an\\napothecary, or a clerk of a Writer to the Signet. Still, the New\\nEnglanders were academic and classical. New England has, by this time,\\nestablished a tradition of its literary origin and character. Her\\nchildren are sons of the Puritans, with their independence, their\\nnarrowness, their appreciation of comfort, their hardiness in doing\\nwithout it, their singular scruples of conscience, their sense of the\\nawfulness of sin, their accessibility to superstition. We can read of\\nthe later New Englanders in the making, among the works of Cotton Mather,\\nhis father Increase Mather, and the witch-burning, periwig-hating,\\ndoctrinal Judge Sewall, who so manfully confessed and atoned for his\\nmistake about the Salem witches. These men, or many of them, were deeply-\\nlearned Calvinists, according to the standard of their day, a day lasting\\nfrom, say, the Restoration to 1730. Cotton Mather, in particular, is\\nerudite, literary--nay, full of literary vanity--mystical, visionary,\\ncredulous to an amusing degree.\\nBut he is really as British as Baxter, or his Scottish correspondent and\\ncounterpart, Wodrow. The sons or grandsons of these men gained the War\\nof Independence. Of this they are naturally proud, and the circumstance\\nis not infrequently mentioned in Dr. Holmes\\'s works. Their democracy is\\nnot roaring modern democracy, but that of the cultivated middle classes.\\nTheir stern Calvinism slackened into many \"isms,\" but left a kind of\\nreligiosity behind it. One of Dr. Holmes\\'s mouthpieces sums up his whole\\ncreed in the two words _Pater Noster_. All these hereditary influences\\nare consciously made conspicuous in Dr. Holmes\\'s writings, as in\\nHawthorne\\'s. In Hawthorne you see the old horror of sin, the old terror\\nof conscience, the old dread of witchcraft, the old concern about\\nconduct, converted into aesthetic sources of literary pleasure, of\\nliterary effects.\\nAs a physician and a man of science, Dr. Holmes added abundant knowledge\\nof the new sort; and apt, unexpected bits of science made popular,\\nanalogies and illustrations afforded by science are frequent in his\\nworks. Thus, in \"Elsie Venner,\" and in \"The Guardian Angel,\" \"heredity\"\\nis his theme. He is always brooding over the thought that each of us is\\nso much made up of earlier people, our ancestors, who bequeath to us so\\nmany disagreeable things--vice, madness, disease, emotions, tricks of\\ngesture. No doubt these things are bequeathed, but all in such new\\nproportions and relations, that each of us is himself and nobody else,\\nand therefore had better make up his mind to _be_ himself, and for\\nhimself responsible.\\nAll this doctrine of heredity, still so dimly understood, Dr. Holmes\\nderives from science. But, in passing through his mind, that of a New\\nEnglander conscious of New England\\'s past, science takes a stain of\\nromance and superstition. Elsie Venner, through an experience of her\\nmother\\'s, inherits the nature of the serpent, so the novel is as far from\\ncommon life as the tale of \"Melusine,\" or any other echidna. The fantasy\\nhas its setting in a commonplace New England environment, and thus\\nrecalls a Hawthorne less subtle and concentrated, but much more humorous.\\nThe heroine of the \"Guardian Angel,\" again, exposes a character in\\nlayers, as it were, each stratum of consciousness being inherited from a\\ndifferent ancestor--among others, a red Indian. She has many\\npersonalities, like the queer women we read about in French treatises on\\nhysterics and nervous diseases. These stories are \"fairy tales of\\nscience,\" by a man of science, who is also a humourist, and has a touch\\nof the poet, and of the old fathers who were afraid of witches. The\\n\"blend\" is singular enough, and not without its originality of\\nfascination.\\nThough a man of science Dr. Holmes apparently took an imaginative\\npleasure in all shapes of superstition that he could muster. I must\\nquote a passage from \"The Professor at the Breakfast Table,\" as\\npeculiarly illustrative of his method, and his ways of half accepting the\\nabnormally romantic--accepting just enough for pleasure, like Sir Walter\\nScott. Connected with the extract is a curious anecdote.\\n\"I think I am a little superstitious. There were two things, when I was\\na boy, that diabolised my imagination,--I mean, that gave me a distinct\\napprehension of a formidable bodily shape which prowled round the\\nneighbourhood where I was born and bred. The first was a series of marks\\ncalled the \\'Devil\\'s footsteps.\\' These were patches of sand in the\\npastures, where no grass grew, where even the low-bush blackberry, the\\n\\'dewberry,\\' as our Southern neighbours call it, in prettier and more\\nShakespearian language, did not spread its clinging creepers, where even\\nthe pale, dry, sadly-sweet \\'everlasting\\' could not grow, but all was bare\\nand blasted. The second was a mark in one of the public buildings near\\nmy home,--the college dormitory named after a Colonial Governor. I do\\nnot think many persons are aware of the existence of this mark,--little\\nhaving been said about the story in print, as it was considered very\\ndesirable, for the sake of the Institution, to hush it up. In the north-\\nwest corner, and on the level of the third or fourth storey, there are\\nsigns of a breach in the walls, mended pretty well, but not to be\\nmistaken. A considerable portion of that corner must have been carried\\naway, from within outward. It was an unpleasant affair, and I do not\\ncare to repeat the particulars; but some young men had been using sacred\\nthings in a profane and unlawful way, when the occurrence, which was\\nvariously explained, took place. The story of the Appearance in the\\nchamber was, I suppose, invented afterwards; but of the injury to the\\nbuilding there could be no question; and the zigzag line, where the\\nmortar is a little thicker than before, is still distinctly visible.\\n\"The queer burnt spots, called the \\'Devil\\'s footsteps,\\' had never\\nattracted attention before this time, though there is no evidence that\\nthey had not existed previously, except that of the late Miss M., a\\n\\'Goody,\\' so called, who was positive on the subject, but had a strange\\nhorror of referring to an affair of which she was thought to know\\nsomething . . . I tell you it was not so pleasant for a little boy of\\nimpressible nature to go up to bed in an old gambrel-roofed house, with\\nuntenanted locked upper chambers, and a most ghostly garret,--with\\n\\'Devil\\'s footsteps\\' in the fields behind the house, and in front of it\\nthe patched dormitory, where the unexplained occurrence had taken place\\nwhich startled those godless youths at their mock devotions, so that one\\nof them was epileptic from that day forward, and another, after a\\ndreadful season of mental conflict, took to religion, and became renowned\\nfor his ascetic sanctity.\"\\nIt is a pity that Dr. Holmes does not give the whole story, instead of\\nhinting at it, for a similar tale is told at Brazenose College, and\\nelsewhere. Now take, along with Dr. Holmes\\'s confession to a grain of\\nsuperstition, this remark on, and explanation of, the curious\\ncoincidences which thrust themselves on the notice of most people.\\n\"Excuse me,--I return to my story of the Commonstable. Young fellows\\nbeing always hungry, and tea and dry toast being the meagre fare of the\\nevening meal, it was a trick of some of the boys to impale a slice of\\nmeat upon a fork, at dinner-time, and stick the fork, holding it, beneath\\nthe table, so that they could get it at tea-time. The dragons that\\nguarded this table of the Hesperides found out the trick at last, and\\nkept a sharp look-out for missing forks;--they knew where to find one, if\\nit was not in its place. Now the odd thing was, that, after waiting so\\nmany years to hear of this College trick, I should hear it mentioned a\\n_second time_ within the same twenty-four hours by a College youth of the\\npresent generation. Strange, but true. And so it has happened to me and\\nto every person, often and often, to be hit in rapid succession by these\\ntwinned facts or thoughts, as if they were linked like chain-shot.\\n\"I was going to leave the simple reader to wonder over this, taking it as\\nan unexplained marvel. I think, however, I will turn over a furrow of\\nsubsoil in it. The explanation is, of course, that in a great many\\nthoughts there must be a few coincidences, and these instantly arrest our\\nattention. Now we shall probably never have the least idea of the\\nenormous number of impressions which pass through our consciousness,\\nuntil in some future life we see the photographic record of our thoughts\\nand the stereoscopic picture of our actions.\\n\"Now, my dear friends, who are putting your hands to your foreheads, and\\nsaying to yourselves that you feel a little confused, as if you had been\\nwaltzing until things began to whirl slightly round you, is it possible\\nthat you do not clearly apprehend the exact connection of all I have been\\nsaying, and its bearing on what is now to come? Listen, then. The\\nnumber of these living elements in our bodies illustrates the\\nincalculable multitude of our thoughts; the number of our thoughts\\naccounts for those frequent coincidences spoken of; these coincidences in\\nthe world of thought illustrate those which we constantly observe in the\\nworld of outward events.\"\\nNow for the anecdote--one of Mark Twain\\'s.\\nSome years ago, Mark Twain published in _Harper\\'s Magazine_ an article on\\n\"Mental Telegraphy.\" He illustrated his meaning by a story of how he\\nonce wrote a long letter on a complicated subject, which had popped into\\nhis head between asleep and awake, to a friend on the other side of\\nAmerica. He did not send the letter, but, by return of post, received\\none from his friend. \"Now, I\\'ll tell you what he is going to say,\" said\\nMark Twain, read his own unsent epistle aloud, and then, opening his\\nfriend\\'s despatch, proved that they were essentially identical. This is\\nwhat he calls \"Mental Telegraphy\"; others call it \"Telepathy,\" and the\\nterm is merely descriptive.\\nNow, on his own showing, in our second extract, Dr. Holmes should have\\nexplained coincidences like this as purely the work of chance, and I\\nrather incline to think that he would have been right. But Mark Twain,\\nin his article on \"Mental Telegraphy,\" cites Dr. Holmes for a story of\\nhow he once, after dinner, as his letters came in, felt constrained to\\ntell, _a propos des bottes_, the story of the last challenge to judicial\\ncombat in England (1817). He then opened a newspaper directed to him\\nfrom England, the _Sporting Times_, and therein his eyes lighted on an\\naccount of this very affair--Abraham Thornton\\'s challenge to battle when\\nhe was accused of murder, in 1817. According to Mark Twain, Dr. Holmes\\nwas disposed to accept \"Mental Telegraphy\" rather than mere chance as the\\ncause of this coincidence. Yet the anecdote of the challenge seems to\\nhave been a favourite of his. It occurs in, \"The Professor,\" in the\\nfifth section. Perhaps he told it pretty frequently; probably that is\\nwhy the printed version was sent to him; still, he was a little staggered\\nby the coincidence. There was enough of Cotton Mather in the man of\\nscience to give him pause.\\nThe form of Dr. Holmes\\'s best known books, the set concerned with the\\nbreakfast-table and \"Over the Teacups,\" is not very fortunate. Much\\nconversation at breakfast is a weariness of the flesh. We want to eat\\nwhat is necessary, and then to go about our work or play. If American\\ncitizens in a boarding-house could endure these long palavers, they must\\nhave been very unlike the hasty feeders caricatured in \"Martin\\nChuzzlewit.\" Macaulay may have monologuised thus at his breakfast\\nparties in the Albany; but breakfast parties are obsolete--an\\nunregrettable parcel of things lost. The monologues, or dialogues, were\\npublished serially in the _Atlantic Monthly_, but they have had a\\nvitality and a vogue far beyond those of the magazine _causerie_. Some\\nof their popularity they may owe to the description of the other\\nboarders, and to the kind of novel which connects the fortunes of these\\npersonages. But it is impossible for an Englishman to know whether these\\nAmerican types are exactly drawn or not. Their fortunes do not strongly\\ninterest one, though the \"Sculpin\"--the patriotic, deformed Bostonian,\\nwith his great-great-grandmother\\'s ring (she was hanged for a witch)--is\\na very original and singular creation. The real interest lies in the\\nwit, wisdom, and learning. The wit, now and then, seems to-day rather in\\nthe nature of a \"goak.\" One might give examples, but to do so seems ill-\\nnatured and ungrateful.\\nThere are some very perishable puns. The learning is not so _recherche_\\nas it appeared when we knew nothing of Cotton Mather and Robert Calef,\\nthe author of a book against the persecution of witches. Calef, of\\ncourse, was in the right, but I cannot forgive him for refusing to see a\\nlady, known to Mr. Mather, who floated about in the air. That she did so\\nwas no good reason for hanging or burning a number of parishioners; but,\\ndid she float, and, if so, how? Mr. Calef said it would be a miracle, so\\nhe declined to view the performance. His logic was thin, though of a\\nfamiliar description. Of all old things, at all events, Dr. Holmes was\\nfond. He found America scarcely aired, new and raw, devoid of history\\nand of associations. \"The Tiber has a voice for me, as it whispers to\\nthe piers of the Pons AElius, even more full of meaning than my\\nwell-beloved Charles, eddying round the piles of West Boston Bridge.\" No\\ndoubt this is a common sentiment among Americans.\\nOccasionally, like Hawthorne, they sigh for an historical atmosphere, and\\nthen, when they come to Europe and get it, they do not like it, and think\\nSchenectady, New York, \"a better place.\" It is not easy to understand\\nwhat ailed Hawthorne with Europe; he was extremely caustic in his\\nwritings about that continent, and discontented. Our matrons were so\\nstout and placid that they irritated him. Indeed, they are a little\\nheavy in hand, still there are examples of agreeable slimness, even in\\nthis poor old country. Fond as he was of the historical past, Mr. Holmes\\nremained loyal to the historical present. He was not one of those\\nAmericans who are always censuring England, and always hankering after\\nher. He had none of that irritable feeling, which made a great\\ncontemporary of his angrily declare that _he_ could endure to hear \"Ye\\nMariners of England\" sung, because of his own country\\'s successes, some\\ntime ago. They were gallant and conspicuous victories of the American\\nfrigates; we do not grudge them. A fair fight should leave no rancour,\\nabove all in the victors, and Dr. Holmes\\'s withers would have been\\nunwrung by Campbell\\'s ditty.\\nHe visited England in youth, and fifty years later. On the anniversary\\nof the American defeat at Bunker\\'s Hill (June 17), Dr. Holmes got his\\ndegree in the _old_ Cambridge. He received degrees at Edinburgh and at\\nOxford, in his \"Hundred Days in Europe\" he says very little about these\\nhistoric cities. The men at Oxford asked, \"Did he come in the \\'One Hoss\\nShay\\'?\" the name of his most familiar poem in the lighter vein. The\\nwhole visit to England pleased and wearied him. He likened it to the\\n_shass caffy_ of Mr. Henry Foker--the fillip at the end of the long\\nbanquet of life. He went to see the Derby, for he was fond of horses, of\\nracing, and, in a sportsmanlike way, of boxing. He had the great\\nboldness once, _audax juventa_, to write a song in praise of that\\ncomfortable creature--wine. The prudery of many Americans about the\\njuice of the grape is a thing very astonishing to a temperate Briton. An\\nadmirable author, who wrote an account of the old convivial days of an\\nAmerican city, found that reputable magazines could not accept such a\\ndegrading historical record. There was no nonsense about Dr. Holmes. His\\npoems were mainly \"occasional\" verses for friendly meetings; or humorous,\\nlike the celebrated \"One Horse Shay.\" Of his serious verses, the\\n\"Nautilus\" is probably too familiar to need quotation; a noble fancy is\\nnobly and tunefully \"moralised.\" Pleasing, cultivated, and so forth, are\\nadjectives not dear to poets. To say \"sublime,\" or \"magical,\" or\\n\"strenuous,\" of Dr. Holmes\\'s muse, would be to exaggerate. How far he\\nmaintained his scholarship, I am not certain; but it is odd that, in his\\npreface to \"The Guardian Angel,\" he should quote from \"Jonathan Edwards\\nthe younger,\" a story for which he might have cited Aristotle.\\nWere I to choose one character out of Dr. Holmes\\'s creations as my\\nfavourite, it would be \"a frequent correspondent of his,\" and of mine--the\\nimmortal Gifted Hopkins. Never was minor poet more kindly and genially\\nportrayed. And if one had to pick out three of his books, as the best\\nworth reading, they would be \"The Professor,\" \"Elsie Venner,\" and \"The\\nGuardian Angel.\" They have not the impeccable art and distinction of\\n\"The House of the Seven Gables\" and \"The Scarlet Letter,\" but they\\ncombine fantasy with living human interest, and with humour. With Sir\\nThomas Browne, and Dr. John Brown, and--may we not add Dr. Weir\\nMitchell?--Dr. Holmes excellently represents the physician in humane\\nletters. He has left a blameless and most amiable memory, unspotted by\\nthe world. His works are full of the savour of his native soil,\\nnaturally, without straining after \"Americanism;\" and they are national,\\nnot local or provincial. He crossed the great gulf of years, between the\\ncentral age of American literary production--the time of Hawthorne and\\nPoe--to our own time, and, like Nestor, he reigned among the third\\ngeneration. As far as the world knows, the shadow of a literary quarrel\\nnever fell on him; he was without envy or jealousy, incurious of his own\\nplace, never vain, petulant, or severe. He was even too good-humoured,\\nand the worst thing I have heard of him is that he could never say \"no\"\\nto an autograph hunter.\\nCHAPTER V: MR. MORRIS\\'S POEMS\\n\"Enough,\" said the pupil of the wise Imlac, \"you have convinced me that\\nno man can be a poet.\" The study of Mr. William Morris\\'s poems, in the\\nnew collected edition, {5} has convinced me that no man, or, at least, no\\nmiddle-aged man, can be a critic. I read Mr. Morris\\'s poems (thanks to\\nthe knightly honours conferred on the Bard of Penrhyn, there is now no\\nambiguity as to \\'Mr. Morris\\'), but it is not the book only that I read.\\nThe scroll of my youth is unfolded. I see the dear place where first I\\nperused \"The Blue Closet\"; the old faces of old friends flock around me;\\nold chaff, old laughter, old happiness re-echo and revive. St. Andrews,\\nOxford, come before the mind\\'s eye, with\\n \"Many a place\\n That\\'s in sad case\\n Where joy was wont afore, oh!\"\\nas Minstrel Burne sings. These voices, faces, landscapes mingle with the\\nmusic and blur the pictures of the poet who enchanted for us certain\\nhours passed in the paradise of youth. A reviewer who finds himself in\\nthis case may as well frankly confess that he can no more criticise Mr.\\nMorris dispassionately than he could criticise his old self and the\\nfriends whom he shall never see again, till he meets them\\n \"Beyond the sphere of time,\\n And sin, and grief\\'s control,\\n Serene in changeless prime\\n Of body and of soul.\"\\nTo write of one\\'s own \"adventures among books\" may be to provide\\nanecdotage more or less trivial, more or less futile, but, at least, it\\nis to write historically. We know how books have affected, and do affect\\nourselves, our bundle of prejudices and tastes, of old impressions and\\nrevived sensations. To judge books dispassionately and impersonally, is\\nmuch more difficult--indeed, it is practically impossible, for our own\\ntastes and experiences must, more or less, modify our verdicts, do what\\nwe will. However, the effort must be made, for to say that, at a certain\\nage, in certain circumstances, an individual took much pleasure in \"The\\nLife and Death of Jason,\" the present of a college friend, is certainly\\nnot to criticise \"The Life and Death of Jason.\"\\nThere have been three blossoming times in the English poetry of the\\nnineteenth century. The first dates from Wordsworth, Coleridge, Scott,\\nand, later, from Shelley, Byron, Keats. By 1822 the blossoming time was\\nover, and the second blossoming time began in 1830-1833, with young Mr.\\nTennyson and Mr. Browning. It broke forth again, in 1842 and did not\\npractically cease till England\\'s greatest laureate sang of the \"Crossing\\nof the Bar.\" But while Tennyson put out his full strength in 1842, and\\nMr. Browning rather later, in \"Bells and Pomegranates\" (\"Men and Women\"),\\nthe third spring came in 1858, with Mr. Morris\\'s \"Defence of Guenevere,\"\\nand flowered till Mr. Swinburne\\'s \"Atalanta in Calydon\" appeared in 1865,\\nfollowed by his poems of 1866. Mr. Rossetti\\'s book of 1870 belonged, in\\ndate of composition, mainly to this period.\\nIn 1858, when \"The Defence of Guenevere\" came out, Mr. Morris must have\\nbeen but a year or two from his undergraduateship. Every one has heard\\nenough about his companions, Mr. Burne Jones, Mr. Rossetti, Canon Dixon,\\nand the others of the old _Oxford and Cambridge Magazine_, where Mr.\\nMorris\\'s wonderful prose fantasies are buried. Why should they not be\\nrevived, these strangely coloured and magical dreams? As literature, I\\nprefer them vastly above Mr. Morris\\'s later romances in prose--\"The\\nHollow Land\" above \"News from Nowhere!\" Mr. Morris and his friends were\\nactive in the fresh dawn of a new romanticism, a mediaeval and Catholic\\nrevival, with very little Catholicism in it for the most part. This\\nrevival is more \"innerly,\" as the Scotch say, more intimate, more\\n\"earnest\" than the larger and more genial, if more superficial,\\nrestoration by Scott. The painful doubt, the scepticism of the Ages of\\nFaith, the dark hours of that epoch, its fantasy, cruelty, luxury, no\\nless than its colour and passion, inform Mr. Morris\\'s first poems. The\\nfourteenth and the early fifteenth century is his \"period.\" In \"The\\nDefence of Guenevere\" he is not under the influence of Chaucer, whose\\nnarrative manner, without one grain of his humour, inspires \"The Life and\\nDeath of Jason\" and \"The Earthly Paradise.\" In the early book the rugged\\nstyle of Mr. Browning has left a mark. There are cockney rhymes, too,\\nsuch as \"short\" rhyming to \"thought.\" But, on the whole, Mr. Morris\\'s\\nearly manner was all his own, nor has he ever returned to it. In the\\nfirst poem, \"The Queen\\'s Apology,\" is this passage:--\\n \"Listen: suppose your time were come to die,\\n And you were quite alone and very weak;\\n Yea, laid a-dying, while very mightily\\n \"The wind was ruffling up the narrow streak\\n Of river through your broad lands running well:\\n Suppose a hush should come, then some one speak:\\n \"\\'One of these cloths is heaven, and one is hell,\\n Now choose one cloth for ever, which they be,\\n I will not tell you, you must somehow tell\\n \"\\'Of your own strength and mightiness; here, see!\\'\\n Yea, yea, my lord, and you to ope your eyes,\\n At foot of your familiar bed to see\\n \"A great God\\'s angel standing, with such dyes,\\n Not known on earth, on his great wings, and hands,\\n Held out two ways, light from the inner skies\\n \"Showing him well, and making his commands\\n Seem to be God\\'s commands, moreover, too,\\n Holding within his hands the cloths on wands;\\n \"And one of these strange choosing-cloths was blue,\\n Wavy and long, and one cut short and red;\\n No man could tell the better of the two.\\n \"After a shivering half-hour you said,\\n \\'God help! heaven\\'s colour, the blue;\\' and he said, \\'Hell.\\'\\n Perhaps you then would roll upon your bed,\\n \"And cry to all good men that loved you well,\\n \\'Ah, Christ! if only I had known, known, known.\\'\"\\nThere was nothing like that before in English poetry; it has the\\n_bizarrerie_ of a new thing in beauty. How far it is really beautiful\\nhow can I tell? How can I discount the \"personal bias\"? Only I know\\nthat it is unforgettable. Again (Galahad speaks):--\\n \"I saw\\n One sitting on the altar as a throne,\\n Whose face no man could say he did not know,\\n And, though the bell still rang, he sat alone,\\n With raiment half blood-red, half white as snow.\"\\nSuch things made their own special ineffaceable impact.\\nLeaving the Arthurian cycle, Mr. Morris entered on his especially\\nsympathetic period--the gloom and sad sunset glory of the late fourteenth\\ncentury, the age of Froissart and wicked, wasteful wars. To Froissart it\\nall seemed one magnificent pageant of knightly and kingly fortunes; he\\nonly murmurs a \"great pity\" for the death of a knight or the massacre of\\na town. It is rather the pity of it that Mr. Morris sees: the hearts\\nbroken in a corner, as in \"Sir Peter Harpedon\\'s End,\" or beside \"The\\nHaystack in the Floods.\" Here is a picture like life of what befell a\\nhundred times. Lady Alice de la Barde hears of the death of her knight:--\\n \"ALICE\\n \"Can you talk faster, sir?\\n Get over all this quicker? fix your eyes\\n On mine, I pray you, and whate\\'er you see\\n Still go on talking fast, unless I fall,\\n Or bid you stop.\\n \"SQUIRE\\n \"I pray your pardon then,\\n And looking in your eyes, fair lady, say\\n I am unhappy that your knight is dead.\\n Take heart, and listen! let me tell you all.\\n We were five thousand goodly men-at-arms,\\n And scant five hundred had he in that hold;\\n His rotten sandstone walls were wet with rain,\\n And fell in lumps wherever a stone hit;\\n Yet for three days about the barriers there\\n The deadly glaives were gather\\'d, laid across,\\n And push\\'d and pull\\'d; the fourth our engines came;\\n But still amid the crash of falling walls,\\n And roar of bombards, rattle of hard bolts,\\n The steady bow-strings flash\\'d, and still stream\\'d out\\n St. George\\'s banner, and the seven swords,\\n And still they cried, \\'St. George Guienne,\\' until\\n Their walls were flat as Jericho\\'s of old,\\n And our rush came, and cut them from the keep.\"\\nThe astonishing vividness, again, of the tragedy told in \"Geffray Teste\\nNoire\" is like that of a vision in a magic mirror or a crystal ball,\\nrather than like a picture suggested by printed words. \"Shameful Death\"\\nhas the same enchanted kind of presentment. We look through a \"magic\\ncasement opening on the foam\" of the old waves of war. Poems of a pure\\nfantasy, unequalled out of Coleridge and Poe, are \"The Wind\" and \"The\\nBlue Closet.\" Each only lives in fantasy. Motives, and facts, and\\n\"story\" are unimportant and out of view. The pictures arise distinct,\\nunsummoned, spontaneous, like the faces and places which are flashed on\\nour eyes between sleeping and waking. Fantastic, too, but with more of a\\nrecognisable human setting, is \"Golden Wings,\" which to a slight degree\\nreminds one of Theophile Gautier\\'s _Chateau de Souvenir_.\\n \"The apples now grow green and sour\\n Upon the mouldering castle wall,\\n Before they ripen there they fall:\\n There are no banners on the tower,\\n The draggled swans most eagerly eat\\n The green weeds trailing in the moat;\\n Inside the rotting leaky boat\\n You see a slain man\\'s stiffen\\'d feet.\"\\nThese, with \"The Sailing of the Sword,\" are my own old favourites. There\\nwas nothing like them before, nor will be again, for Mr. Morris, after\\nseveral years of silence, abandoned his early manner. No doubt it was\\nnot a manner to persevere in, but happily, in a mood and a moment never\\nto be re-born or return, Mr. Morris did fill a fresh page in English\\npoetry with these imperishable fantasies. They were absolutely neglected\\nby \"the reading public,\" but they found a few staunch friends. Indeed, I\\nthink of \"Guenevere\" as FitzGerald did of Tennyson\\'s poems before 1842.\\nBut this, of course, is a purely personal, probably a purely capricious,\\nestimate. Criticism may aver that the influence of Mr. Rossetti was\\nstrong on Mr. Morris before 1858. Perhaps so, but we read Mr. Morris\\nfirst (as the world read the \"Lay\" before \"Christabel\"), and my own\\npreference is for Mr. Morris.\\nIt was after eight or nine years of silence that Mr. Morris produced, in\\n1866 or 1867, \"The Life and Death of Jason.\" Young men who had read\\n\"Guenevere\" hastened to purchase it, and, of course, found themselves in\\ncontact with something very unlike their old favourite. Mr. Morris had\\ntold a classical tale in decasyllabic couplets of the Chaucerian sort,\\nand he regarded the heroic age from a mediaeval point of view; at all\\nevents, not from an historical and archaeological point of view. It was\\nnatural in Mr. Morris to \"envisage\" the Greek heroic age in this way, but\\nit would not be natural in most other writers. The poem is not much\\nshorter than the \"Odyssey,\" and long narrative poems had been out of\\nfashion since \"The Lord of the Isles\" (1814).\\nAll this was a little disconcerting. We read \"Jason,\" and read it with\\npleasure, but without much of the more essential pleasure which comes\\nfrom magic and distinction of style. The peculiar qualities of Keats,\\nand Tennyson, and Virgil are not among the gifts of Mr. Morris. As\\npeople say of Scott in his long poems, so it may be said of Mr.\\nMorris--that he does not furnish many quotations, does not glitter in\\n\"jewels five words long.\"\\nIn \"Jason\" he entered on his long career as a narrator; a poet retelling\\nthe immortal primeval stories of the human race. In one guise or another\\nthe legend of Jason is the most widely distributed of romances; the North\\nAmerican Indians have it, and the Samoans and the Samoyeds, as well as\\nall Indo-European peoples. This tale, told briefly by Pindar, and at\\ngreater length by Apollonius Rhodius, and in the \"Orphica,\" Mr. Morris\\ntook up and handled in a single and objective way. His art was always\\npictorial, but, in \"Jason\" and later, he described more, and was less\\napt, as it were, to flash a picture on the reader, in some incommunicable\\nway.\\nIn the covers of the first edition were announcements of the \"Earthly\\nParadise\": that vast collection of the world\\'s old tales retold. One\\nmight almost conjecture that \"Jason\" had originally been intended for a\\npart of the \"Earthly Paradise,\" and had outgrown its limits. The tone is\\nmuch the same, though the \"criticism of life\" is less formally and\\nexplicitly stated.\\nFor Mr. Morris came at last to a \"criticism of life.\" It would not have\\nsatisfied Mr. Matthew Arnold, and it did not satisfy Mr. Morris! The\\nburden of these long narrative poems is _vanitas vanitatum_: the\\nfleeting, perishable, unsatisfying nature of human existence, the dream\\n\"rounded by a sleep.\" The lesson drawn is to make life as full and as\\nbeautiful as may be, by love, and adventure, and art. The hideousness of\\nmodern industrialism was oppressing to Mr. Morris; that hideousness he\\nwas doing his best to relieve and redeem, by poetry, and by all the many\\narts and crafts in which he was a master. His narrative poems are,\\nindeed, part of his industry in this field. He was not born to slay\\nmonsters, he says, \"the idle singer of an empty day.\" Later, he set\\nabout slaying monsters, like Jason, or unlike Jason, scattering dragon\\'s\\nteeth to raise forces which he could not lay, and could not direct.\\nI shall go no further into politics or agitation, and I say this much\\nonly to prove that Mr. Morris\\'s \"criticism of life,\" and prolonged,\\nwistful dwelling on the thought of death, ceased to satisfy himself. His\\nown later part, as a poet and an ally of Socialism, proved this to be\\ntrue. It seems to follow that the peculiarly level, lifeless, decorative\\neffect of his narratives, which remind us rather of glorious tapestries\\nthan of pictures, was no longer wholly satisfactory to himself. There is\\nplenty of charmed and delightful reading--\"Jason\" and the \"Earthly\\nParadise\" are literature for The Castle of Indolence, but we do miss a\\nstrenuous rendering of action and passion. These Mr. Morris had rendered\\nin \"The Defence of Guinevere\": now he gave us something different,\\nsomething beautiful, but something deficient in dramatic vigour.\\nApollonius Rhodius is, no doubt, much of a pedant, a literary writer of\\nepic, in an age of Criticism. He dealt with the tale of \"Jason,\" and\\nconceivably he may have borrowed from older minstrels. But the Medea of\\nApollonius Rhodius, in her love, her tenderness, her regret for home, in\\nall her maiden words and ways, is undeniably a character more living,\\nmore human, more passionate, and more sympathetic, than the Medea of Mr.\\nMorris. I could almost wish that he had closely followed that classical\\noriginal, the first true love story in literature. In the same way I\\nprefer Apollonius\\'s spell for soothing the dragon, as much terser and\\nmore somniferous than the spell put by Mr. Morris into the lips of Medea.\\nScholars will find it pleasant to compare these passages of the\\nAlexandrine and of the London poets. As a brick out of the vast palace\\nof \"Jason\" we may select the song of the Nereid to Hylas--Mr. Morris is\\nalways happy with his Nymphs and Nereids:--\\n \"I know a little garden-close\\n Set thick with lily and with rose,\\n Where I would wander if I might\\n From dewy dawn to dewy night,\\n And have one with me wandering.\\n And though within it no birds sing,\\n And though no pillared house is there,\\n And though the apple boughs are bare\\n Of fruit and blossom, would to God,\\n Her feet upon the green grass trod,\\n And I beheld them as before.\\n There comes a murmur from the shore,\\n And in the place two fair streams are,\\n Drawn from the purple hills afar,\\n Drawn down unto the restless sea;\\n The hills whose flowers ne\\'er fed the bee,\\n The shore no ship has ever seen,\\n Still beaten by the billows green,\\n Whose murmur comes unceasingly\\n Unto the place for which I cry.\\n For which I cry both day and night,\\n For which I let slip all delight,\\n That maketh me both deaf and blind,\\n Careless to win, unskilled to find,\\n And quick to lose what all men seek.\\n Yet tottering as I am, and weak,\\n Still have I left a little breath\\n To seek within the jaws of death\\n An entrance to that happy place,\\n To seek the unforgotten face\\n Once seen, once kissed, once rest from me\\n Anigh the murmuring of the sea.\"\\n\"Jason\" is, practically, a very long tale from the \"Earthly Paradise,\" as\\nthe \"Earthly Paradise\" is an immense treasure of shorter tales in the\\nmanner of \"Jason.\" Mr. Morris reverted for an hour to his fourteenth\\ncentury, a period when London was \"clean.\" This is a poetic license;\\nmany a plague found mediaeval London abominably dirty! A Celt himself,\\nno doubt, with the Celt\\'s proverbial way of being _impossibilium\\ncupitor_, Mr. Morris was in full sympathy with his Breton Squire, who, in\\nthe reign of Edward III., sets forth to seek the Earthly Paradise, and\\nthe land where Death never comes. Much more dramatic, I venture to\\nthink, than any passage of \"Jason,\" is that where the dreamy seekers of\\ndreamland, Breton and Northman, encounter the stout King Edward III.,\\nwhose kingdom is of this world. Action and fantasy are met, and the\\nwanderers explain the nature of their quest. One of them speaks of death\\nin many a form, and of the flight from death:--\\n \"His words nigh made me weep, but while he spoke\\n I noted how a mocking smile just broke\\n The thin line of the Prince\\'s lips, and he\\n Who carried the afore-named armoury\\n Puffed out his wind-beat cheeks and whistled low:\\n But the King smiled, and said, \\'Can it be so?\\n I know not, and ye twain are such as find\\n The things whereto old kings must needs be blind.\\n For you the world is wide--but not for me,\\n Who once had dreams of one great victory\\n Wherein that world lay vanquished by my throne,\\n And now, the victor in so many an one,\\n Find that in Asia Alexander died\\n And will not live again; the world is wide\\n For you I say,--for me a narrow space\\n Betwixt the four walls of a fighting place.\\n Poor man, why should I stay thee? live thy fill\\n Of that fair life, wherein thou seest no ill\\n But fear of that fair rest I hope to win\\n One day, when I have purged me of my sin.\\n Farewell, it yet may hap that I a king\\n Shall be remembered but by this one thing,\\n That on the morn before ye crossed the sea\\n Ye gave and took in common talk with me;\\n But with this ring keep memory with the morn,\\n O Breton, and thou Northman, by this horn\\n Remember me, who am of Odin\\'s blood.\\'\"\\nAll this encounter is a passage of high invention. The adventures in\\nAnahuac are such as Bishop Erie may have achieved when he set out to find\\nVinland the Good, and came back no more, whether he was or was not\\nremembered by the Aztecs as Quetzalcoatl. The tale of the wanderers was\\nMr. Morris\\'s own; all the rest are of the dateless heritage of our race,\\nfairy tales coming to us, now \"softly breathed through the flutes of the\\nGrecians,\" now told by Sagamen of Iceland. The whole performance is\\nastonishingly equable; we move on a high tableland, where no tall peaks\\nof Parnassus are to be climbed. Once more literature has a narrator, on\\nthe whole much more akin to Spenser than to Chaucer, Homer, or Sir\\nWalter. Humour and action are not so prominent as contemplation of a\\npageant reflected in a fairy mirror. But Mr. Morris has said himself,\\nabout his poem, what I am trying to say:--\\n \"Death have we hated, knowing not what it meant;\\n Life have we loved, through green leaf and through sere,\\n Though still the less we knew of its intent;\\n The Earth and Heaven through countless year on year,\\n Slow changing, were to us but curtains fair,\\n Hung round about a little room, where play\\n Weeping and laughter of man\\'s empty day.\"\\nMr. Morris had shown, in various ways, the strength of his sympathy with\\nthe heroic sagas of Iceland. He had rendered one into verse, in \"The\\nEarthly Paradise,\" above all, \"Grettir the Strong\" and \"The Volsunga\" he\\nhad done into English prose. His next great poem was \"The Story of\\nSigurd,\" a poetic rendering of the theme which is, to the North, what the\\nTale of Troy is to Greece, and to all the world. Mr. Morris took the\\nform of the story which is most archaic, and bears most birthmarks of its\\nsavage origin--the version of the \"Volsunga,\" not the German shape of the\\n\"Nibelungenlied.\" He showed extraordinary skill, especially in making\\nhuman and intelligible the story of Regin, Otter, Fafnir, and the Dwarf\\nAndvari\\'s Hoard.\\n \"It was Reidmar the Ancient begat me; and now was he waxen old,\\n And a covetous man and a king; and he bade, and I built him a hall,\\n And a golden glorious house; and thereto his sons did he call,\\n And he bade them be evil and wise, that his will through them might be\\n wrought.\\n Then he gave unto Fafnir my brother the soul that feareth nought,\\n And the brow of the hardened iron, and the hand that may never fail,\\n And the greedy heart of a king, and the ear that hears no wail.\\n \"But next unto Otter my brother he gave the snare and the net,\\n And the longing to wend through the wild-wood, and wade the highways\\n wet;\\n And the foot that never resteth, while aught be left alive\\n That hath cunning to match man\\'s cunning or might with his might to\\n strive.\\n \"And to me, the least and the youngest, what gift for the slaying of\\n ease?\\n Save the grief that remembers the past, and the fear that the future\\n sees;\\n And the hammer and fashioning-iron, and the living coal of fire;\\n And the craft that createth a semblance, and fails of the heart\\'s\\n desire;\\n And the toil that each dawning quickens, and the task that is never\\n done;\\n And the heart that longeth ever, nor will look to the deed that is\\n won.\\n \"Thus gave my father the gifts that might never be taken again;\\n Far worse were we now than the Gods, and but little better than men.\\n But yet of our ancient might one thing had we left us still:\\n We had craft to change our semblance, and could shift us at our will\\n Into bodies of the beast-kind, or fowl, or fishes cold;\\n For belike no fixed semblance we had in the days of old,\\n Till the Gods were waxen busy, and all things their form must take\\n That knew of good and evil, and longed to gather and make.\"\\nBut when we turn to the passage of the _eclaircissement_ between Sigurd\\nand Brynhild, that most dramatic and most _modern_ moment in the ancient\\ntragedy, the moment where the clouds of savage fancy scatter in the light\\nof a hopeless human love, then, I must confess, I prefer the simple,\\nbrief prose of Mr. Morris\\'s translation of the \"Volsunga\" to his rather\\nperiphrastic paraphrase. Every student of poetry may make the comparison\\nfor himself, and decide for himself whether the old or the new is better.\\nAgain, in the final fight and massacre in the hall of Atli, I cannot but\\nprefer the Slaying of the Wooers, at the close of the \"Odyssey,\" or the\\nlast fight of Roland at Roncesvaux, or the prose version of the\\n\"Volsunga.\" All these are the work of men who were war-smiths as well as\\nsong-smiths. Here is a passage from the \"murder grim and great\":--\\n \"So he saith in the midst of the foemen with his war-flame reared on\\n high,\\n But all about and around him goes up a bitter cry\\n From the iron men of Atli, and the bickering of the steel\\n Sends a roar up to the roof-ridge, and the Niblung war-ranks reel\\n Behind the steadfast Gunnar: but lo, have ye seen the corn,\\n While yet men grind the sickle, by the wind streak overborne\\n When the sudden rain sweeps downward, and summer groweth black,\\n And the smitten wood-side roareth \\'neath the driving thunder-wrack?\\n So before the wise-heart Hogni shrank the champions of the East\\n As his great voice shook the timbers in the hall of Atli\\'s feast,\\n There he smote and beheld not the smitten, and by nought were his\\n edges stopped;\\n He smote and the dead were thrust from him; a hand with its shield he\\n lopped;\\n There met him Atli\\'s marshal, and his arm at the shoulder he shred;\\n Three swords were upreared against him of the best of the kin of the\\n dead;\\n And he struck off a head to the rightward, and his sword through a\\n throat he thrust,\\n But the third stroke fell on his helm-crest, and he stooped to the\\n ruddy dust,\\n And uprose as the ancient Giant, and both his hands were wet:\\n Red then was the world to his eyen, as his hand to the labour he set;\\n Swords shook and fell in his pathway, huge bodies leapt and fell;\\n Harsh grided shield and war-helm like the tempest-smitten bell,\\n And the war-cries ran together, and no man his brother knew,\\n And the dead men loaded the living, as he went the war-wood through;\\n And man \\'gainst man was huddled, till no sword rose to smite,\\n And clear stood the glorious Hogni in an island of the fight,\\n And there ran a river of death \\'twixt the Niblung and his foes,\\n And therefrom the terror of men and the wrath of the Gods arose.\"\\nI admit that this does not affect me as does the figure of Odysseus\\nraining his darts of doom, or the courtesy of Roland when the blinded\\nOliver smites him by mischance, and, indeed, the Keeping of the Stair by\\nUmslopogaas appeals to me more vigorously as a strenuous picture of war.\\nTo be just to Mr. Morris, let us give his rendering of part of the\\nSlaying of the Wooers, from his translation of the \"Odyssey\":--\\n \"And e\\'en as the word he uttered, he drew his keen sword out\\n Brazen, on each side shearing, and with a fearful shout\\n Rushed on him; but Odysseus that very while let fly\\n And smote him with the arrow in the breast, the pap hard by,\\n And drove the swift shaft to the liver, and adown to the ground fell\\n the sword\\n From out of his hand, and doubled he hung above the board,\\n And staggered; and whirling he fell, and the meat was scattered\\n around,\\n And the double cup moreover, and his forehead smote the ground;\\n And his heart was wrung with torment, and with both feet spurning he\\n smote\\n The high-seat; and over his eyen did the cloud of darkness float.\\n \"And then it was Amphinomus, who drew his whetted sword\\n And fell on, making his onrush \\'gainst Odysseus the glorious lord,\\n If perchance he might get him out-doors: but Telemachus him forewent,\\n And a cast of the brazen war-spear from behind him therewith sent\\n Amidmost of his shoulders, that drave through his breast and out,\\n And clattering he fell, and the earth all the breadth of his forehead\\n smote.\"\\nThere is no need to say more of Mr. Morris\\'s \"Odysseus.\" Close to the\\nletter of the Greek he usually keeps, but where are the surge and thunder\\nof Homer? Apparently we must accent the penultimate in \"Amphinomus\" if\\nthe line is to scan. I select a passage of peaceful beauty from Book\\nV.:--\\n \"But all about that cavern there grew a blossoming wood,\\n Of alder and of poplar and of cypress savouring good;\\n And fowl therein wing-spreading were wont to roost and be,\\n For owls were there and falcons, and long-tongued crows of the sea,\\n And deeds of the sea they deal with and thereof they have a care\\n But round the hollow cavern there spread and flourished fair\\n A vine of garden breeding, and in its grapes was glad;\\n And four wells of the white water their heads together had,\\n And flowing on in order four ways they thence did get;\\n And soft were the meadows blooming with parsley and violet.\\n Yea, if thither indeed had come e\\'en one of the Deathless, e\\'en he\\n Had wondered and gladdened his heart with all that was there to see.\\n And there in sooth stood wondering the Flitter, the Argus-bane.\\n But when o\\'er all these matters in his soul he had marvelled amain,\\n Then into the wide cave went he, and Calypso, Godhead\\'s Grace,\\n Failed nowise there to know him as she looked upon his face;\\n For never unknown to each other are the Deathless Gods, though they\\n Apart from one another may be dwelling far away.\\n But Odysseus the mighty-hearted within he met not there,\\n Who on the beach sat weeping, as oft he was wont to wear\\n His soul with grief and groaning, and weeping; yea, and he\\n As the tears he was pouring downward yet gazed o\\'er the untilled sea.\"\\nThis is close enough to the Greek, but\\n \"_And flowing on in order four ways they thence did get_\"\\nis not precisely musical. Why is Hermes \"The Flitter\"? But I have often\\nventured to remonstrate against these archaistic peculiarities, which to\\nsome extent mar our pleasure in Mr. Morris\\'s translations. In his\\nversion of the rich Virgilian measure they are especially out of place.\\nThe \"AEneid\" is rendered with a roughness which might better befit a\\ntranslation of Ennius. Thus the reader of Mr. Morris\\'s poetical\\ntranslations has in his hands versions of almost literal closeness, and\\n(what is extremely rare) versions of poetry by a poet. But his\\nacquaintance with Early English and Icelandic has added to the poet a\\nstrain of the philologist, and his English in the \"Odyssey,\" still more\\nin the \"AEneid,\" is occasionally more _archaic_ than the Greek of 900\\nB.C. So at least it seems to a reader not unversed in attempts to fit\\nthe classical poets with an English rendering. But the true test is in\\nthe appreciation of the lovers of poetry in general.\\nTo them, as to all who desire the restoration of beauty in modern life,\\nMr. Morris has been a benefactor almost without example. Indeed, were\\nadequate knowledge mine, Mr. Morris\\'s poetry should have been criticised\\nas only a part of the vast industry of his life in many crafts and many\\narts. His place in English life and literature is unique as it is\\nhonourable. He did what he desired to do--he made vast additions to\\nsimple and stainless pleasures.\\nCHAPTER VI: MRS. RADCLIFFE\\'S NOVELS\\nDoes any one now read Mrs. Radcliffe, or am I the only wanderer in her\\nwindy corridors, listening timidly to groans and hollow voices, and\\nshielding the flame of a lamp, which, I fear, will presently flicker out,\\nand leave me in darkness? People know the name of \"The Mysteries of\\nUdolpho;\" they know that boys would say to Thackeray, at school, \"Old\\nfellow, draw us Vivaldi in the Inquisition.\" But have they penetrated\\ninto the chill galleries of the Castle of Udolpho? Have they shuddered\\nfor Vivaldi in face of the sable-clad and masked Inquisition? Certainly\\nMrs. Radcliffe, within the memory of man, has been extremely popular. The\\nthick double-columned volume in which I peruse the works of the\\nEnchantress belongs to a public library. It is quite the dirtiest,\\ngreasiest, most dog\\'s-eared, and most bescribbled tome in the collection.\\nMany of the books have remained, during the last hundred years, uncut,\\neven to this day, and I have had to apply the paper knife to many an\\nauthor, from Alciphron (1790) to Mr. Max Muller, and Dr. Birkbeck Hill\\'s\\nedition of Bozzy\\'s \"Life of Dr. Johnson.\" But Mrs. Radcliffe has been\\nread diligently, and copiously annotated.\\nThis lady was, in a literary sense, and though, like the sire of Evelina,\\nhe cast her off, the daughter of Horace Walpole. Just when King Romance\\nseemed as dead as Queen Anne, Walpole produced that Gothic tale, \"The\\nCastle of Otranto,\" in 1764. In that very year was born Anne Ward, who,\\nin 1787, married William Radcliffe, Esq., M.A., Oxon. In 1789 she\\npublished \"The Castles of Athlin and Dunbayne.\" The scene, she tells us,\\nis laid in \"the most romantic part of the Highlands, the north-east coast\\nof Scotland.\" On castles, anywhere, she doted. Walpole, not Smollett or\\nMiss Burney, inspired her with a passion for these homes of old romance.\\nBut the north-east coast of Scotland is hardly part of the Highlands at\\nall, and is far from being very romantic. The period is \"the dark ages\"\\nin general. Yet the captive Earl, when \"the sweet tranquillity of\\nevening threw an air of tender melancholy over his mind . . . composed\\nthe following sonnet, which (having committed it to paper) he the next\\nevening dropped upon the terrace. He had the pleasure to observe that\\nthe paper was taken up by the ladies, who immediately retired into the\\ncastle.\" These were not the manners of the local Mackays, of the\\nSinclairs, and of \"the small but fierce clan of Gunn,\" in the dark ages.\\nBut this was Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s way. She delighted in descriptions of\\nscenery, the more romantic the better, and usually drawn entirely from\\nher inner consciousness. Her heroines write sonnets (which never but\\nonce _are_ sonnets) and other lyrics, on every occasion. With his usual\\ngenerosity Scott praised her landscape and her lyrics, but, indeed, they\\nare, as Sir Walter said of Mrs. Hemans, \"too poetical,\" and probably they\\nwere skipped, even by her contemporary devotees. \"The Castles of Athlin\\nand Dunbayne\" frankly do not permit themselves to be read, and it was not\\ntill 1790, with \"A Sicilian Romance,\" that Mrs. Radcliffe \"found\\nherself,\" and her public. After reading, with breathless haste, through,\\n\"A Sicilian Romance,\" and \"The Romance of the Forest,\" in a single day,\\nit would ill become me to speak lightly of Mrs. Radcliffe. Like\\nCatherine Morland, I love this lady\\'s tender yet terrific fancy.\\nMrs. Radcliffe does not always keep on her highest level, but we must\\nremember that her last romance, \"The Italian,\" is by far her best. She\\nhad been feeling her way to this pitch of excellence, and, when she had\\nattained to it, she published no more. The reason is uncertain. She\\nbecame a Woman\\'s Rights woman, and wrote \"The Female Advocate,\" not a\\nnovel! Scott thinks that she may have been annoyed by her imitators, or\\nby her critics, against whom he defends her in an admirable passage, to\\nbe cited later. Meanwhile let us follow Mrs. Radcliffe in her upward\\ncourse.\\nThe \"Sicilian Romance\" appeared in 1790, when the author\\'s age was twenty-\\nsix. The book has a treble attraction, for it contains the germ of\\n\"Northanger Abbey,\" and the germ of \"Jane Eyre,\" and--the germ of Byron!\\nLike \"Joseph Andrews,\" \"Northanger Abbey\" began as a parody (of Mrs.\\nRadcliffe) and developed into a real novel of character. So too Byron\\'s\\ngloomy scowling adventurers, with their darkling past, are mere\\nrepetitions in rhyme of Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s Schedoni. This is so obvious\\nthat, when discussing Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s Schedoni, Scott adds, in a note,\\nparallel passages from Byron\\'s \"Giaour.\" Sir Walter did not mean to\\nmock, he merely compared two kindred spirits. \"The noble poet\" \"kept on\\nthe business still,\" and broke into octosyllabics, borrowed from Scott,\\nhis descriptions of miscreants borrowed from Mrs. Radcliffe.\\n\"A Sicilian Romance\" has its scene in the palace of Ferdinand, fifth\\nMarquis of Mazzini, on the northern coast of Sicily. The time is about\\n1580, but there is nothing in the manners or costume to indicate that, or\\nany other period. Such \"local colour\" was unknown to Mrs. Radcliffe, as\\nto Clara Reeve. In Horace Walpole, however, a character goes so far in\\nthe mediaeval way as to say \"by my halidome.\"\\nThe Marquis Mazzini had one son and two daughters by his first amiable\\nconsort, supposed to be long dead when the story opens. The son is the\\noriginal of Henry Tilney in \"Northanger Abbey,\" and in General Tilney\\ndoes Catherine Morland recognise a modern Marquis of Mazzini. But the\\nMarquis\\'s wife, to be sure, is _not_ dead; like the first Mrs. Rochester\\nshe is concealed about the back premises, and, as in \"Jane Eyre,\" it is\\nher movements, and those of her gaolers, that produce mystery, and make\\nthe reader suppose that \"the place is haunted.\" It is, of course, only\\nthe mystery and the \"machinery\" of Mrs. Radcliffe that Miss Bronte\\nadapted. These passages in \"Jane Eyre\" have been censured, but it is not\\neasy to see how the novel could do without them. Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s tale\\nentirely depends on its machinery. Her wicked Marquis, having secretly\\nimmured Number One, has now a new and beautiful Number Two, whose\\ncharacter does not bear inspection. This domestic position, as Number\\nTwo, we know, was declined by the austere virtue of Jane Eyre.\\n\"Phenomena\" begin in the first chapter of \"A Sicilian Romance,\"\\nmysterious lights wander about uninhabited parts of the castle, and are\\nvainly investigated by young Ferdinand, son of the Marquis. This\\nHippolytus the Chaste, loved all in vain by the reigning Marchioness, is\\nadored by, and adores, her stepdaughter, Julia. Jealousy and revenge are\\nclearly indicated. But, in chasing mysterious lights and figures through\\nmouldering towers, Ferdinand gets into the very undesirable position of\\nDavid Balfour, when he climbs, in the dark, the broken turret stair in\\nhis uncle\\'s house of Shaws (in \"Kidnapped\"). Here is a _fourth_ author\\nindebted to Mrs. Radcliffe: her disciples are Miss Austen, Byron, Miss\\nBronte, and Mr. Louis Stevenson! Ferdinand \"began the ascent. He had\\nnot proceeded very far, when the stones of a step which his foot had just\\nquitted gave way, and, dragging with them those adjoining, formed a chasm\\nin the staircase that terrified even Ferdinand, who was left tottering on\\nthe suspended half of the steps, in momentary expectation of falling to\\nthe bottom with the stone on which he rested. In the terror which this\\noccasioned, he attempted to save himself by catching at a kind of beam\\nwhich suspended over the stairs, when the lamp dropped from his hand, and\\nhe was left in total darkness.\"\\nCan anything be more \"amazing horrid,\" above all as there are mysterious\\nfigures in and about the tower? Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s lamps always fall, or\\nare blown out, in the nick of time, an expedient already used by Clara\\nReeve in that very mild but once popular ghost story, \"The Old English\\nBaron\" (1777). All authors have such favourite devices, and I wonder how\\nmany fights Mr. Stanley Weyman\\'s heroes have fought, from the cellar to\\ntheir favourite tilting ground, the roof of a strange house!\\nFerdinand hung on to the beam for an hour, when the ladies came with a\\nlight, and he scrambled back to solid earth. In his next nocturnal\\nresearch, \"a sullen groan arose from beneath where he stood,\" and when he\\ntried to force a door (there are scores of such weird doors in Mrs.\\nRadcliffe) \"a groan was repeated, more hollow and dreadful than the\\nfirst. His courage forsook him\"--and no wonder! Of course he could not\\nknow that the author of the groans was, in fact, his long-lost mother,\\nimmured by his father, the wicked Marquis. We need not follow the\\nnarrative through the darkling crimes and crumbling galleries of this\\nterrible castle on the north coast of Sicily. Everybody is always\\n\"gazing in silent terror,\" and all the locks are rusty. \"A savage and\\ndexterous banditti\" play a prominent part, and the imprisoned Ferdinand\\n\"did not hesitate to believe that the moans he heard came from the\\nrestless spirit of the murdered della Campo.\" No working hypothesis\\ncould seem more plausible, but it was erroneous. Mrs. Radcliffe does not\\ndeal in a single avowed ghost. She finally explains away, by normal\\ncauses, everything that she does not forget to explain. At the most, she\\nindulges herself in a premonitory dream. On this point she is true to\\ncommon sense, without quite adopting the philosophy of David Hume. \"I do\\nnot say that spirits have appeared,\" she remarks, \"but if several\\ndiscreet unprejudiced persons were to assure me that they had seen one--I\\nshould not be bold or proud enough to reply, it is impossible!\" But Hume\\n_was_ bold and proud enough: he went further than Mrs. Radcliffe.\\nScott censures Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s employment of explanations. He is in\\nfavour of \"boldly avowing the use of supernatural machinery,\" or of\\nleaving the matter in the vague, as in the appearance of the wraith of\\nthe dying Alice to Ravenswood. But, in Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s day, common\\nsense was so tyrannical, that the poor lady\\'s romances would have been\\nexcluded from families, if she had not provided normal explanations of\\nher groans, moans, voices, lights, and wandering figures. The ghost-hunt\\nin the castle finally brings Julia to a door, whose bolts, \"strengthened\\nby desperation, she forced back.\" There was a middle-aged lady in the\\nroom, who, after steadily gazing on Julia, \"suddenly exclaimed, \\'My\\ndaughter!\\' and fainted away.\" Julia being about seventeen, and Madame\\nMazzini, her mamma, having been immured for fifteen years, we observe, in\\nthis recognition, the force of the maternal instinct.\\nThe wicked Marquis was poisoned by the partner of his iniquities, who\\nanon stabbed herself with a poniard. The virtuous Julia marries the\\nchaste Hippolytus, and, says the author, \"in reviewing this story, we\\nperceive a singular and striking instance of moral retribution.\"\\nWe also remark the futility of locking up an inconvenient wife, fabled to\\nbe defunct, in one\\'s own country house. Had Mr. Rochester, in \"Jane\\nEyre,\" studied the \"Sicilian Romance,\" he would have shunned an obsolete\\nsystem, inconvenient at best, and apt, in the long run, to be disastrous.\\nIn the \"Romance of the Forest\" (1791), Mrs. Radcliffe remained true to\\nMr. Stanley Weyman\\'s favourite period, the end of the sixteenth century.\\nBut there are no historical characters or costumes in the story, and all\\nthe persons, as far as language and dress go, might have been alive in\\n1791.\\nThe story runs thus: one de la Motte, who appears to have fallen from\\ndissipation to swindling, is, on the first page, discovered flying from\\nParis and the law, with his wife, in a carriage. Lost in the dark on a\\nmoor, he follows a light, and enters an old lonely house. He is seized\\nby ruffians, locked in, and expects to be murdered, which he knows that\\nhe cannot stand, for he is timid by nature. In fact, a ruffian puts a\\npistol to La Motte\\'s breast with one hand, while with the other he drags\\nalong a beautiful girl of eighteen. \"Swear that you will convey this\\ngirl where I may never see her more,\" exclaims the bully, and La Motte,\\nwith the young lady, is taken back to his carriage. \"If you return\\nwithin an hour you will be welcomed with a brace of bullets,\" is the\\nruffian\\'s parting threat.\\nSo La Motte, Madame La Motte, and the beautiful girl drive away, La\\nMotte\\'s one desire being to find a retreat safe from the police of an\\noffended justice.\\nIs this not a very original, striking, and affecting situation;\\nprovocative, too, of the utmost curiosity? A fugitive from justice, in a\\nstrange, small, dark, ancient house, is seized, threatened, and presented\\nwith a young and lovely female stranger. In this opening we recognise\\nthe hand of a master genius. There _must_ be an explanation of\\nproceedings so highly unconventional, and what can the reason be? The\\nreader is _empoigne_ in the first page, and eagerly follows the flight of\\nLa Motte, also of Peter, his coachman, an attached, comic, and familiar\\ndomestic. After a few days, the party observe, in the recesses of a\\ngloomy forest, the remains of a Gothic abbey. They enter; by the light\\nof a flickering lamp they penetrate \"horrible recesses,\" discover a room\\nhandsomely provided with a trapdoor, and determine to reside in a\\ndwelling so congenial, though, as La Motte judiciously remarks, \"not in\\nall respects strictly Gothic.\" After a few days, La Motte finds that\\nsomebody is inquiring for him in the nearest town. He seeks for a hiding-\\nplace, and explores the chambers under the trapdoor. Here he finds, in a\\nlarge chest--what do you suppose he finds? It was a human skeleton! Yet\\nin this awful vicinity he and his wife, with Adeline (the fair stranger)\\nconceal themselves. The brave Adeline, when footsteps are heard, and a\\nfigure is beheld in the upper rooms, accosts the stranger. His keen eye\\npresently detects the practicable trapdoor, he raises it, and the\\ncowering La Motte recognises in the dreaded visitor--his own son, who had\\nsought him out of filial affection.\\nAlready Madame La Motte has become jealous of Adeline, especially as her\\nhusband is oddly melancholy, and apt to withdraw into a glade, where he\\nmysteriously disappears into the recesses of a genuine Gothic sepulchre.\\nThis, to the watchful eyes of a wife, is proof of faithlessness on the\\npart of a husband. As the son, Louis, really falls in love with Adeline,\\nMadame La Motte becomes doubly unkind to her, and Adeline now composes\\nquantities of poems to Night, to Sunset, to the Nocturnal Gale, and so\\non.\\nIn this uncomfortable situation, two strangers arrive in a terrific\\nthunderstorm. One is young, the other is a Marquis. On seeing this\\nnobleman, \"La Motte\\'s limbs trembled, and a ghastly paleness overspread\\nhis countenance. The Marquis was little less agitated,\" and was, at\\nfirst, decidedly hostile. La Motte implored forgiveness--for what?--and\\nthe Marquis (who, in fact, owned the Abbey, and had a shooting lodge not\\nfar off) was mollified. They all became rather friendly, and Adeline\\nasked La Motte about the stories of hauntings, and a murder said to have\\nbeen, at some time, committed in the Abbey. La Motte said that the\\nMarquis could have no connection with such fables; still, there _was_ the\\nskeleton.\\nMeanwhile, Adeline had conceived a flame for Theodore, the young officer\\nwho accompanied his colonel, the Marquis, on their first visit to the\\nfamily. Theodore, who returned her passion, had vaguely warned her of an\\nimpending danger, and then had failed to keep tryst with her, one\\nevening, and had mysteriously disappeared. Then unhappy Adeline dreamed\\nabout a prisoner, a dying man, a coffin, a voice from the coffin, and the\\nappearance within it of the dying man, amidst torrents of blood. The\\nchamber in which she saw these visions was most vividly represented. Next\\nday the Marquis came to dinner, and, _though reluctantly_, consented to\\npass the night: Adeline, therefore, was put in a new bedroom. Disturbed\\nby the wind shaking the mouldering tapestry, she found a concealed door\\nbehind the arras and a suite of rooms, _one of which was the chamber of\\nher dream_! On the floor lay a rusty dagger! The bedstead, being\\ntouched, crumbled, and disclosed a small roll of manuscripts. They were\\nnot washing bills, like those discovered by Catherine Morland in\\n\"Northanger Abbey.\" Returning to her own chamber, Adeline heard the\\nMarquis professing to La Motte a passion for herself. Conceive her\\nhorror! Silence then reigned, till all was sudden noise and confusion;\\nthe Marquis flying in terror from his room, and insisting on instant\\ndeparture. His emotion was powerfully displayed.\\nWhat had occurred? Mrs. Radcliffe does not say, but horror, whether\\ncaused by a conscience ill at ease, or by events of a terrific and\\nsupernatural kind, is plainly indicated. In daylight, the Marquis\\naudaciously pressed his unholy suit, and even offered marriage, a hollow\\nmockery, for he was well known to be already a married man. The scenes\\nof Adeline\\'s flight, capture, retention in an elegant villa of the\\nlicentious noble, renewed flight, rescue by Theodore, with Theodore\\'s\\narrest, and wounding of the tyrannical Marquis, are all of breathless\\ninterest. Mrs. Radcliffe excels in narratives of romantic escapes, a\\ntopic always thrilling when well handled. Adeline herself is carried\\nback to the Abbey, but La Motte, who had rather not be a villain if he\\ncould avoid it, enables her again to secure her freedom. He is clearly\\nin the power of the Marquis, and his life has been unscrupulous, but he\\nretains traces of better things. Adeline is now secretly conveyed to a\\npeaceful valley in Savoy, the home of the honest Peter (the coachman),\\nwho accompanies her. Here she learns to know and value the family of La\\nLuc, the kindred of her Theodore (by a romantic coincidence), and, in the\\nadorable scenery of Savoy, she throws many a ballad to the Moon.\\nLa Motte, on the discovery of Adeline\\'s flight, was cast into prison by\\nthe revengeful Marquis, for, in fact, soon after settling in the Abbey,\\nit had occurred to La Motte to commence highwayman. His very first\\nvictim had been the Marquis, and, during his mysterious retreats to a\\ntomb in a glade in the forest, he had, in short, been contemplating his\\nbooty, jewels which he could not convert into ready money. Consequently,\\nwhen the Marquis first entered the Abbey, La Motte had every reason for\\nalarm, and only pacified the vindictive aristocrat by yielding to his\\ncruel schemes against the virtue of Adeline.\\nHappily for La Motte, a witness appeared at his trial, who cast a lurid\\nlight on the character of the Marquis. That villain, to be plain, had\\nmurdered his elder brother (the skeleton of the Abbey), and had been\\nanxious to murder, it was added, his own natural daughter--that is,\\nAdeline! His hired felons, however, placed her in a convent, and, later\\n(rather than kill her, on which the Marquis insisted), simply thrust her\\ninto the hands of La Motte, who happened to pass by that way, as we saw\\nin the opening of this romance. Thus, in making love to Adeline, his\\ndaughter, the Marquis was, unconsciously, in an awkward position. On\\nfurther examination of evidence, however, things proved otherwise.\\nAdeline was _not_ the natural daughter of the Marquis, but his niece, the\\nlegitimate daughter and heiress of his brother (the skeleton of the\\nAbbey). The MS. found by Adeline in the room of the rusty dagger added\\ndocumentary evidence, for it was a narrative of the sufferings of her\\nfather (later the skeleton), written by him in the Abbey where he was\\nimprisoned and stabbed, and where his bones were discovered by La Motte.\\nThe hasty nocturnal flight of the Marquis from the Abbey is thus\\naccounted for: he had probably been the victim of a terrific\\nhallucination representing his murdered brother; whether it was veridical\\nor merely subjective Mrs. Radcliffe does not decide. Rather than face\\nthe outraged justice of his country, the Marquis, after these\\nrevelations, took poison. La Motte was banished; and Adeline, now\\nmistress of the Abbey, removed the paternal skeleton to \"the vault of his\\nancestors.\" Theodore and Adeline were united, and virtuously resided in\\na villa on the beautiful banks of the Lake of Geneva.\\nSuch is the \"Romance of the Forest,\" a fiction in which character is\\nsubordinate to plot and incident. There is an attempt at character\\ndrawing in La Motte, and in his wife; the hero and heroine are not\\ndistinguishable from Julia and Hippolytus. But Mrs. Radcliffe does not\\naim at psychological niceties, and we must not blame her for withholding\\nwhat it was no part of her purpose to give. \"The Romance of the Forest\"\\nwas, so far, infinitely the most thrilling of modern English works of\\nfiction. \"Every reader felt the force,\" says Scott, \"from the sage in\\nhis study, to the family group in middle life,\" and nobody felt it more\\nthan Scott himself, then a young gentleman of nineteen, who, when asked\\nhow his time was employed, answered, \"I read no Civil Law.\" He did read\\nMrs. Radcliffe, and, in \"The Betrothed,\" followed her example in the\\nstory of the haunted chamber where the heroine faces the spectre attached\\nto her ancient family.\\n\"The Mysteries of Udolpho,\" Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s next and most celebrated\\nwork, is not (in the judgment of this reader, at least) her masterpiece.\\nThe booksellers paid her what Scott, erroneously, calls \"the\\nunprecedented sum of 500 pounds\" for the romance, and they must have made\\na profitable bargain. \"The public,\" says Scott, \"rushed upon it with all\\nthe eagerness of curiosity, and rose from it with unsated appetite.\" I\\narise with a thoroughly sated appetite from the \"Mysteries of Udolpho.\"\\nThe book, as Sir Walter saw, is \"The Romance of the Forest\" raised to a\\nhigher power. We have a similar and similarly situated heroine, cruelly\\ndetached from her young man, and immured in a howling wilderness of a\\nbrigand castle in the Apennines. In place of the Marquis is a miscreant\\non a larger and more ferocious scale. The usual mysteries of voices,\\nlights, secret passages, and innumerable doors are provided regardless of\\neconomy. The great question, which I shall not answer, is, _what did the\\nBlack Veil conceal_? _Not_ \"the bones of Laurentina,\" as Catherine\\nMorland supposed.\\nHere is Emily\\'s adventure with the veil. \"She paused again, and then,\\nwith a timid hand, lifted the veil; but instantly let it fall--perceiving\\nthat what it had concealed was no picture, and before she could leave the\\nchamber she dropped senseless on the floor. When she recovered her\\nrecollection, . . . horror occupied her mind.\" Countless mysteries\\ncoagulate around this veil, and the reader is apt to be disappointed when\\nthe awful curtain is withdrawn. But he has enjoyed, for several hundred\\npages, the pleasures of anticipation. A pedantic censor may remark that,\\nwhile the date of the story is 1580, all the virtuous people live in an\\nidyllic fashion, like creatures of Rousseau, existing solely for\\nlandscape and the affections, writing poetry on Nature, animate and\\ninanimate, including the common Bat, and drawing in water colours. In\\nthose elegant avocations began, and in these, after an interval of\\nadventures \"amazing horrid,\" concluded the career of Emily.\\nMrs. Radcliffe keeps the many entangled threads of her complex web well\\nin hand, and incidents which puzzle you at the beginning fall naturally\\ninto place before the end. The character of the heroine\\'s silly, vain,\\nunkind, and unreasonable aunt is vividly designed (that Emily should\\nmistake the corse of a moustached bandit for that of her aunt is an\\nincident hard to defend). Valancourt is not an ordinary spotless hero,\\nbut sows his wild oats, and reaps the usual harvest; and Annette is a\\ngood sample of the usual _soubrette_. When one has said that the\\nlandscapes and bandits of this romance are worthy of Poussin and Salvator\\nRosa, from whom they were probably translated into words, not much\\nremains to be added. Sir Walter, after repeated perusals, considered\\n\"Udolpho\" \"a step beyond Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s former work, high as that had\\njustly advanced her.\" But he admits that \"persons of no mean judgment\"\\npreferred \"The Romance of the Forest.\" With these amateurs I would be\\nranked. The ingenuity and originality of the \"Romance\" are greater: our\\nfriend the skeleton is better than that Thing which was behind the Black\\nVeil, the escapes of Adeline are more thrilling than the escape of Emily,\\nand the \"Romance\" is not nearly so long, not nearly so prolix as\\n\"Udolpho.\"\\nThe roof and crown of Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s work is \"The Italian\" (1797), for\\nwhich she received 800 pounds. {6} The scene is Naples, the date about\\n1764; the topic is the thwarted loves of Vivaldi and Ellena; the villain\\nis the admirable Schedoni, the prototype of Byron\\'s lurid characters.\\n\"The Italian\" is an excellent novel. The Prelude, \"the dark and vaulted\\ngateway,\" is not unworthy of Hawthorne, who, I suspect, had studied Mrs.\\nRadcliffe. The theme is more like a theme of this world than usual. The\\nparents of a young noble might well try to prevent him from marrying an\\nunknown and penniless girl. The Marchese Vivaldi only adopts the\\nordinary paternal measures; the Marchesa, and her confessor the\\ndark-souled Schedoni, go farther--as far as assassination. The casuistry\\nby which Schedoni brings the lady to this pass, while representing her as\\nthe originator of the scheme, is really subtle, and the scenes between\\nthe pair show an extraordinary advance on Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s earlier art.\\nThe mysterious Monk who counteracts Schedoni remains an unsolved mystery\\nto me, but of that I do not complain. He is as good as the Dweller in\\nthe Catacombs who haunts Miriam in Hawthorne\\'s \"Marble Faun.\" The\\nInquisition, its cells, and its tribunals are coloured\\n \"As when some great painter dips\\n His pencil in the gloom of earthquake and eclipse.\"\\nThe comic valet, Paulo, who insists on being locked up in the dungeons of\\nthe Inquisition merely because his master is there, reminds one of Samuel\\nWeller, he is a Neapolitan Samivel. The escapes are Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s\\nmost exciting escapes, and to say that is to say a good deal. Poetry is\\nnot written, or not often, by the heroine. The scene in which Schedoni\\nhas his dagger raised to murder Ellena, when he discovers that she is his\\ndaughter, \"is of a new, grand, and powerful character\" (Scott), while it\\nis even more satisfactory to learn later that Ellena was _not_ Schedoni\\'s\\ndaughter after all.\\nWhy Mrs. Radcliffe, having reached such a pitch of success, never again\\npublished a novel, remains more mysterious than any of her Mysteries.\\nScott justly remarks that her censors attacked her \"by showing that she\\ndoes not possess the excellences proper to a style of composition totally\\ndifferent from that which she has attempted.\" This is the usual way of\\nreviewers. Tales that fascinated Scott, Fox, and Sheridan, \"which\\npossess charms for the learned and unlearned, the grave and gay, the\\ngentleman and clown,\" do not deserve to be dismissed with a sneer by\\npeople who have never read them. Following Horace Walpole in some\\ndegree, Mrs. Radcliffe paved the way for Scott, Byron, Maturin, Lewis,\\nand Charlotte Bronte, just as Miss Burney filled the gap between Smollett\\nand Miss Austen. Mrs. Radcliffe, in short, kept the Lamp of Romance\\nburning much more steadily than the lamps which, in her novels, are\\nalways blown out, in the moment of excited apprehension, by the night\\nwind walking in the dank corridors of haunted abbeys. But mark the\\ncruelty of an intellectual parent! Horace Walpole was Mrs. Radcliffe\\'s\\nfather in the spirit. Yet, on September 4, 1794, he wrote to Lady\\nOssory: \"I have read some of the descriptive verbose tales, of which your\\nLadyship says I was the patriarch by several mothers\" (Miss Reeve and\\nMrs. Radcliffe?). \"All I can say for myself is that I do not think my\\nconcubines have produced issue more natural for excluding the aid of\\nanything marvellous.\"\\nCHAPTER VII: A SCOTTISH ROMANTICIST OF 1830\\nThe finding of a rare book that you have wanted long is one of the\\nhappier moments in life. Whatever we may think of life when we\\ncontemplate it as a whole, it is a delight to discover what one has\\nsought for years, especially if the book be a book which you really want\\nto read, and not a thing whose value is given by the fashion of\\ncollecting. Perhaps nobody ever collected before\\n THE\\n DEATH-WAKE, OR LUNACY\\n A NECROMAUNT\\n In Three Chimeras\\n BY THOMAS T. STODDART.\\n \"Is\\'t like that lead contains her?--\\n It were too gross\\n To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.\"--\\n _Shakespeare_.\\n EDINBURGH:\\n Printed for HENRY CONSTABLE, Edinburgh,\\n And HURST, CHANCE, & CO., London.\\n MDCCCXXXI.\\nThis is my rare book, and it is rare for an excellent good reason, as\\nwill be shown. But first of the author. Mr. Thomas Tod Stoddart was\\nborn in 1810. He died in 1880. Through all his pilgrimage of\\nthree-score years and ten, his \"rod and staff did comfort him,\" as the\\nScottish version of the Psalms has it; nay, his staff was his rod. He\\n\"was an angler,\" as he remarked when a friend asked: \"Well, Tom, what are\\nyou doing now.\" He was the patriarch, the Father Izaak, of Scottish\\nfishers, and he sleeps, according to his desire, like Scott, within\\nhearing of the Tweed. His memoir, published by his daughter, in\\n\"Stoddart\\'s Angling Songs\" (Blackwood), is an admirable biography, _quo\\nfit ut omnis Votiva pateat veluti descripta tabella Vita senis_.\\nBut it is with the \"young Tom Stoddart,\" the poet of twenty, not with the\\nold angling sage, that we have to do. Miss Stoddart has discreetly\\nrepublished only the Angling Songs of her father, the pick of them being\\nclassical in their way. Now, as Mr. Arnold writes:--\\n \"Two desires toss about\\n The poet\\'s feverish blood,\\n One drives him to the world without,\\n And one to solitude.\"\\nThe young Stoddart\\'s two desires were poetry and fishing. He began with\\npoetry. \"At the age of ten his whole desire was to produce an immortal\\ntragedy . . . Blood and battle were the powers with which he worked, and\\nwith no meaner tool. Every other dramatic form he despised.\" It is\\ncurious to think of the schoolboy, the born Romanticist, labouring at\\nthese things, while Gerard de Nerval, and Victor Hugo, and Theophile\\nGautier, and Petrus Borel were boys also--boys of the same ambitions, and\\nwith much the same romantic tastes. Stoddart had, luckily, another love\\nbesides the Muse. \"With the spring and the May fly, the dagger dipped in\\ngore paled before the supple rod, and the dainty midge.\" Finally, the\\nrod and midge prevailed.\\n \"Wee dour-looking hooks are the thing,\\n Mouse body and laverock wing.\"\\nBut before he quite abandoned all poetry save fishing ditties, he wrote\\nand published the volume whose title-page we have printed, \"The Death\\nWake.\" The lad who drove home from an angling expedition in a hearse had\\nan odd way of combining his amusements. He lived among poets and critics\\nwho were anglers--Hogg, the Ettrick Shepherd (who cast but a heavy line,\\nthey say, in Yarrow), Aytoun, Christopher North, De Quincey--\\n \"No fisher\\n But a well-wisher\\n To the game,\"\\nas Scott has it--these were his companions, older or younger. None of\\nthese, certainly not Wilson, nor Hogg, nor Aytoun, were friends of the\\nRomantic school, as illustrated by Keats and Shelley. None of them\\nprobably knew much of Gautier, De Nerval, Borel, le lycanthrope, and the\\nother boys in that boyish movement of 1830. It was only Stoddart,\\nunconsciously in sympathy with Paris, and censured by his literary\\nfriends, who produced the one British Romantic work of 1830. The title\\nitself shows that he was partly laughing at his own performance; he has\\nthe mockery of _Les Jeunes France_ in him, as well as the wormy and\\nobituary joys of _La Comedie de la Mort_. The little book came out,\\ninspired by \"all the poetasters.\" Christopher North wrote, four years\\nlater, in _Blackwood\\'s Magazine_, a tardy review. He styled it \"an\\ningeniously absurd poem, with an ingeniously absurd title, written in a\\nstrange, namby-pamby sort of style, between the weakest of Shelley and\\nthe strongest of Barry Cornwall.\" The book \"fell dead from the Press,\"\\nfar more dead than \"Omar Khayyam.\" Nay, misfortune pursued it, Miss\\nStoddart kindly informs me, and it was doomed to the flames. The\\n\"remainder,\" the bulk of the edition, was returned to the poet in sheets,\\nand by him was deposited in a garret. The family had a cook, one Betty,\\na descendant, perhaps, of \"that unhappy Betty or Elizabeth Barnes, cook\\nof Mr. Warburton, Somerset Herald,\" who burned, among other quartos,\\nShakespeare\\'s \"Henry I.,\" \"Henry II.,\" and \"King Stephen.\" True to her\\ninherited instincts, Mr. Stoddart\\'s Betty, slowly, relentlessly, through\\nforty years, used \"The Death Wake\" for the needs and processes of her\\nart. The whole of the edition, except probably a few \"presentation\\ncopies,\" perished in the kitchen. As for that fell cook, let us hope\\nthat\\n \"The Biblioclastic Dead\\n Have diverse pains to brook,\\n They break Affliction\\'s bread\\n With Betty Barnes, the Cook,\"\\nas the author of \"The Bird Bride\" sings.\\nMiss Stoddart had just informed me of this disaster, which left one\\nalmost hopeless of ever owning a copy of \"The Death Wake,\" when I found a\\nbrown paper parcel among many that contained to-day\\'s minor poetry \"with\\nthe author\\'s compliments,\" and lo, in this unpromising parcel was the\\nlong-sought volume! Ever since one was a small boy, reading Stoddart\\'s\\n\"Scottish Angler,\" and old _Blackwood\\'s_, one had pined for a sight of\\n\"The Necromaunt,\" and here, clean in its \"pure purple mantle\" of smooth\\ncloth, lay the desired one!\\n \"Like Dian\\'s kiss, unasked, unsought,\\n It gave itself, and was not bought,\"\\nbeing, indeed, the discovery and gift of a friend who fishes and studies\\nthe Lacustrine Muses.\\nThe copy has a peculiar interest; it once belonged to Aytoun, the writer\\nof \"The Scottish Cavaliers,\" of \"The Bon Gaultier Ballads,\" and of\\n\"Firmilian,\" the scourge of the Spasmodic School. Mr. Aytoun has adorned\\nthe margins with notes and with caricatures of skulls and cross-bones,\\nwhile the fly-leaves bear a sonnet to the author, and a lyric in\\ndoggerel. Surely this is, indeed, a literary curiosity. The sonnet runs\\nthus:--\\n \"O wormy Thomas Stoddart, who inheritest\\n Rich thoughts and loathsome, nauseous words and rare,\\n Tell me, my friend, why is it that thou ferretest\\n And gropest in each death-corrupted lair?\\n Seek\\'st thou for maggots such as have affinity\\n With those in thine own brain, or dost thou think\\n That all is sweet which hath a horrid stink?\\n Why dost thou make Haut-gout thy sole divinity?\\n Here is enough of genius to convert\\n Vile dung to precious diamonds and to spare,\\n Then why transform the diamond into dirt,\\n And change thy mind, which should be rich and fair,\\n Into a medley of creations foul,\\n As if a Seraph would become a Ghoul?\"\\nNo doubt Mr. Stoddart\\'s other passion for angling, in which he used a\\nScottish latitude concerning bait, {7} impelled him to search for \"worms\\nand maggots\":--\\n \"Fire and faggots,\\n Worms and maggots,\"\\nas Aytoun writes on the other fly-leaf, are indeed the matter of \"The\\nDeath Wake.\"\\nThen, why, some one may ask, write about \"The Death Wake\" at all? Why\\nrouse again the nightmare of a boy of twenty? Certainly I am not to say\\nthat \"The Death Wake\" is a pearl of great price, but it does contain\\npassages of poetry--of poetry very curious because it is full of the new\\nnote, the new melody which young Mr. Tennyson was beginning to waken. It\\nanticipates Beddoes, it coincides with Gautier and _Les Chimeres_ of\\nGerard, it answers the accents, then unheard in England, of Poe. Some\\nAmerican who read out of the way things, and was not too scrupulous,\\nrecognised, and robbed, a brother in Tom Stoddart. Eleven years after\\n\"The Death Wake\" appeared in England, it was published in _Graham\\'s\\nMagazine_, as \"Agatha, a Necromaunt in Three Chimeras,\" by Louis\\nFitzgerald Tasistro. Now Poe was closely connected with _Graham\\'s\\nMagazine_, and after \"Arthur Gordon Pym,\" \"Louis Fitzgerald Tasistro\"\\ndoes suggest Edgar Allen Poe. But Poe was not Tasistro.\\nSo much for the literary history of the Lunacy.\\nThe poem begins--Chimera I. begins:--\\n \"An anthem of a sister choristry!\\n And, like a windward murmur of the sea,\\n O\\'er silver shells, so solemnly it falls!\"\\nThe anthem accompanies a procession of holy fathers towards a bier;\\n \"Agathe\\n Was on the lid--a name. And who? No more!\\n \\'Twas only Agathe.\"\\nA solitary monk is prowling around in the moonlit cathedral; he has a\\nbrow of stony marble, he has raven hair, and he falters out the name of\\nAgathe. He has said adieu to that fair one, and to her sister Peace,\\nthat lieth in her grave. He has loved, and loves, the silent Agathe. He\\nwas the son of a Crusader,\\n \"And Julio had fain\\n Have been a warrior, but his very brain\\n Grew fevered at the sickly thought of death,\\n And to be stricken with a want of breath.\"\\nOn the whole he did well not to enter the service. Mr. Aytoun has here\\nwritten--\"A rum Cove for a hussar.\"\\n \"And he would say\\n A curse be on their laurels.\\n And anon\\n Was Julio forgotten and his line--\\n No wonder for this frenzied tale of mine.\"\\nHow? asks Aytoun, nor has the grammatical enigma yet been unriddled.\\n \"Oh! he was wearied of this passing scene!\\n But loved not Death; his purpose was between\\n Life and the grave; and it would vibrate there\\n Like a wild bird that floated far and fair\\n Betwixt the sun and sea!\"\\nSo \"he became monk,\" and was sorry he had done so, especially when he met\\na pretty maid,\\n \"And this was Agathe, young Agathe,\\n A motherless fair girl,\"\\nwhose father was a kind of Dombey, for\\n \"When she smiled\\n He bade no father\\'s welcome to the child,\\n But even told his wish, and will\\'d it done,\\n For her to be sad-hearted, and a nun!\"\\nSo she \"took the dreary veil.\"\\nThey met like a blighted Isabella and Lorenzo:\\n \"They met many a time\\n In the lone chapels after vesper chime,\\n They met in love and fear.\"\\nThen, one day,\\n \"He heard it said:\\n Poor Julio, thy Agathe is dead.\"\\nShe died\\n \"Like to a star within the twilight hours\\n Of morning, and she was not! Some have thought\\n The Lady Abbess gave her a mad draught.\"\\nHere Mr. Aytoun, with sympathy, writes \"Damn her!\" (the Lady Abbess, that\\nis) and suggests that thought must be read \"thaft.\"\\nThrough \"the arras of the gloom\" (arras is good), the pale breezes are\\nmoaning, and Julio is wan as stars unseen for paleness. However, he\\nlifts the tombstone \"as it were lightsome as a summer gladness.\" \"A\\nsummer gladness,\" remarks Mr. Aytoun, \"may possibly weigh about half-an-\\nounce.\" Julio came on a skull, a haggard one, in the grave, and Mr.\\nAytoun kindly designs a skeleton, ringing a bell, and crying \"Dust ho!\"\\nNow go, and give your poems to your friends!\\nFinally Julio unburies Agathe:--\\n \"Thou must go,\\n My sweet betrothed, with me, but not below,\\n Where there is darkness, dream, and solitude,\\n But where is light, and life, and one to brood\\n Above thee, till thou wakest. Ha, I fear\\n Thou wilt not wake for ever, sleeping here,\\n Where there are none but the winds to visit thee.\\n And Convent fathers, and a choristry\\n Of sisters saying Hush! But I will sing\\n Rare songs to thy pure spirit, wandering\\n Down on the dews to hear me; I will tune\\n The instrument of the ethereal moon,\\n And all the choir of stars, to rise and fall\\n In harmony and beauty musical.\"\\nIs this not melodious madness, and is this picture of the distraught\\npriest, setting forth to sail the seas with his dead lady, not an\\ninvention that Nanteuil might have illustrated, and the clan of\\nBousingots approved?\\nThe Second Chimera opens nobly:--\\n \"A curse! a curse! {8} the beautiful pale wing\\n Of a sea-bird was worn with wandering,\\n And, on a sunny rock beside the shore,\\n It stood, the golden waters gazing o\\'er;\\n And they were nearing a brown amber flow\\n Of weeds, that glittered gloriously below!\"\\nJulio appears with Agathe in his arms, and what ensues is excellent of\\nits kind:--\\n \"He dropt upon a rock, and by him placed,\\n Over a bed of sea-pinks growing waste,\\n The silent ladye, and he mutter\\'d wild,\\n Strange words about a mother and no child.\\n \"And I shall wed thee, Agathe! although\\n Ours be no God-blest bridal--even so!\"\\n And from the sand he took a silver shell,\\n That had been wasted by the fall and swell\\n Of many a moon-borne tide into a ring--\\n A rude, rude ring; it was a snow-white thing,\\n Where a lone hermit limpet slept and died\\n In ages far away. \\'Thou art a bride,\\n Sweet Agathe! Wake up; we must not linger!\\'\\n He press\\'d the ring upon her chilly finger,\\n And to the sea-bird on its sunny stone\\n Shouted, \\'Pale priest that liest all alone\\n Upon thy ocean altar, rise, away\\n To our glad bridal!\\' and its wings of gray\\n All lazily it spread, and hover\\'d by\\n With a wild shriek--a melancholy cry!\\n Then, swooping slowly o\\'er the heaving breast\\n Of the blue ocean, vanished in the west.\"\\nJulio sang a mad song of a mad priest to a dead maid:--\\n . . .\\n \"A rosary of stars, love! a prayer as we glide,\\n And a whisper on the wind, and a murmur on the tide,\\n And we\\'ll say a fair adieu to the flowers that are seen,\\n With shells of silver sown in radiancy between.\\n \"A rosary of stars, love! the purest they shall be,\\n Like spirits of pale pearls in the bosom of the sea;\\n Now help thee, {9} Virgin Mother, with a blessing as we go,\\n Upon the laughing waters that are wandering below.\"\\nOne can readily believe that Poe admired this musical sad song, if,\\nindeed, he ever saw the poem.\\nOne may give too many extracts, and there is scant room for the\\nextraordinary witchery of the midnight sea and sky, where the dead and\\nthe distraught drift wandering,\\n \"And the great ocean, like the holy hall,\\n Where slept a Seraph host maritimal,\\n Was gorgeous with wings of diamond\"--\\nit was a sea\\n \"Of radiant and moon-breasted emerald.\"\\nThere follows another song--\\n \"\\'Tis light to love thee living, girl, when hope is full and fair,\\n In the springtide of thy beauty, when there is no sorrow there\\n No sorrow on thy brow, and no shadow on thy heart,\\n When, like a floating sea-bird, bright and beautiful thou art\\n . . .\\n \"But when the brow is blighted, like a star at morning tide\\n And faded is the crimson blush upon the cheek beside,\\n It is to love as seldom love the brightest and the best,\\n When our love lies like a dew upon the one that is at rest.\"\\nWe ought to distrust our own admiration of what is rare, odd, novel to\\nus, found by us in a sense, and especially one must distrust one\\'s liking\\nfor the verses of a Tweedside angler, of a poet whose forebears lie in\\nthe green kirkyard of Yarrow. But, allowing for all this, I cannot but\\nthink these very musical, accomplished, and, in their place, appropriate\\nverses, to have been written by a boy of twenty. Nor is it a common\\nimagination, though busy in this vulgar field of horrors, that lifts the\\npallid bride to look upon the mirror of the sea--\\n \"And bids her gaze into the startled sea,\\n And says, \\'Thine image, from eternity,\\n Hath come to meet thee, ladye!\\' and anon\\n He bade the cold corse kiss the shadowy one\\n That shook amid the waters.\"\\nThe picture of the madness of thirst, allied to the disease of the brain,\\nis extremely powerful, the delirious monk tells the salt sea waves\\n \"That ye have power, and passion, and a sound\\n As of the flying of an angel round\\n The mighty world; that ye are one with time!\"\\nHere, I can\\'t but think, is imagination.\\nMr. Aytoun, however, noted none of those passages, nor that where, in\\ntempest and thunder, a shipwrecked sailor swims to the strange boat, sees\\nthe Living Love and the Dead, and falls back into the trough of the wave.\\nBut even the friendly pencil of Bon Gaultier approves the passage where\\nan isle rises above the sea, and the boat is lightly stranded on the\\nshore of pure and silver shells. The horrors of corruption, in the Third\\nChimera, may be left unquoted, Aytoun parodies--\\n \"The chalk, the chalk, the cheese, the cheese, the cheeses,\\n And straightway dropped he down upon his kneeses.\"\\nJulio comes back to reason, hates the dreadful bride, and feeds on\\nlimpets, \"by the mass, he feasteth well!\"\\nThere was a holy hermit on the isle,\\n \"I ween like other hermits, so was he.\"\\nHe is Agathe\\'s father, and he has retired to an eligible island where he\\nmay repent his cruelty to his daughter. Julio tells his tale, and goes\\nmad again. The apostrophe to Lunacy which follows is marked \"Beautiful\"\\nby Aytoun, and is in the spirit of Charles Lamb\\'s remark that madness has\\npleasures unknown to the sane.\\n \"Thou art, thou art alone,\\n A pure, pure being, but the God on high\\n Is with thee ever as thou goest by.\"\\nJulio watches again beside the Dead, till morning comes, bringing\\n \"A murmur far and far, of those that stirred\\n Within the great encampment of the sea.\"\\nThe tide sweeps the mad and the dead down the shores. \"He perished in a\\ndream.\" As for the Hermit, he buried them, not knowing who they were,\\nbut on a later day found and recognised the golden cross of Agathe,\\n \"For long ago he gave that blessed cross\\n To his fair girl, and knew the relic still.\"\\nSo the Hermit died of remorse, and one cannot say, with Walton, \"and I\\nhope the reader is sorry.\"\\nThe \"other poems\" are vague memories of Shelley, or anticipations of Poe.\\nOne of them is curiously styled \"Her, a Statue,\" and contains a passage\\nthat reminds us of a rubaiyat of Omar\\'s,\\n \"She might see\\n A love-wing\\'d Seraph glide in glory by,\\n Striking the tent of its mortality.\\n \"But that is but a tent wherein may rest\\n A Sultan to the realm of Death addrest;\\n The Sultan rises, and the dark Ferrash\\n Strikes, and prepares it for another guest.\"\\nMost akin to Poe is the \"Hymn to Orion,\"\\n \"Dost thou, in thy vigil, hail\\n Arcturus on his chariot pale,\\n Leading him with a fiery flight--\\n Over the hollow hill of night?\"\\nThis, then, is a hasty sketch, and incomplete, of a book which, perhaps,\\nis only a curiosity, but which, I venture to think, gave promise of a\\npoet. Where is the lad of twenty who has written as well to-day--nay,\\nwhere is the mature person of forty? There was a wind of poetry abroad\\nin 1830, blowing over the barricades of Paris, breathing by the sedges of\\nCam, stirring the heather on the hills of Yarrow. Hugo, Mr. Browning,\\nLord Tennyson, caught the breeze in their sails, and were borne adown the\\nTigris of romance. But the breath that stirred the loch where Tom\\nStoddart lay and mused in his boat, soon became to him merely the curl on\\nthe waters of lone St. Mary\\'s or Loch Skene, and he began casting over\\nthe great uneducated trout of a happier time, forgetful of the Muse. He\\nwrote another piece, with a sonorous and delightful title, \"Ajalon of the\\nWinds.\" Where is \"Ajalon of the Winds\"? Miss Stoddart knows nothing of\\nit, but I fancy that the thrice-loathed Betty could have told a tale.\\n MALIM CONVIVIS QVAM PLACVISSE COQVIS.\\nWe need not, perhaps, regret that Mr. Stoddart withdrew from the\\nstruggles and competitions of poetic literature. No very high place, no\\nvery glorious crown, one fancies, would have been his. His would have\\nbeen anxiety, doubt of self, disappointment, or, if he succeeded, the\\nhatred, and envyings, and lies which even then dogged the steps of the\\nvictor. It was better to be quiet and go a-fishing.\\n \"Sorrow, sorrow speed away\\n To our angler\\'s quiet mound,\\n With the old pilgrim, twilight gray,\\n Enter through the holy ground;\\n There he sleeps whose heart is twined\\n With wild stream and wandering burn,\\n Wooer of the western wind\\n Watcher of the April morn!\"\\nCHAPTER VIII: THE CONFESSIONS OF SAINT AUGUSTINE\\nMy copy of the Confessions is a dark little book, \"a size uncumbersome to\\nthe nicest hand,\" in the format of an Elzevir, bound in black morocco,\\nand adorned with \"blind-tooled,\" that is ungilt, skulls and crossbones.\\nIt has lost the title-page with the date, but retains the frontispiece,\\nengraved by Huret. Saint Augustine, in his mitre and other episcopal\\narray, with a quill in his hand, sits under a flood of inspiring\\nsunshine. The dumpy book has been much read, was at some time the\\nproperty of Mr. John Philips, and bears one touching manuscript note, of\\nwhich more hereafter. It is, I presume, a copy of the translation by Sir\\nToby Matthew. The author of the Preface declares, with truth, that the\\ntranslator \"hath consulted so closely and earnestly with the saint that\\nhe seemeth to have lighted his torch att his fire, and to speak in the\\nbest and most significant English, what and how he would have done had he\\nunderstood our language.\"\\nThere can be no better English version of this famous book, in which\\nSaint Augustine tells the story of his eager and passionate youth--a\\nyouth tossed about by the contending tides of Love, human and divine.\\nReading it to-day, with a mundane curiosity, we may half regret the space\\nwhich he gives to theological metaphysics, and his brief tantalising\\nglimpses of what most interests us now--the common life of men when the\\nChurch was becoming mistress of the world, when the old Religions were\\ndying of allegory and moral interpretations and occult dreams. But, even\\nso, Saint Augustine\\'s interest in himself, in the very obscure origins of\\neach human existence, in the psychology of infancy and youth, in school\\ndisputes, and magical pretensions; his ardent affections, his\\nexultations, and his faults, make his memoirs immortal among the\\nunveilings of the spirit. He has studied babies, that he may know his\\ndark beginnings, and the seeds of grace and of evil. \"Then, by degrees,\\nI began to find where I was; and I had certain desires to declare my will\\nto those by whom it might be executed. But I could not do it, . . .\\ntherefore would I be tossing my arms, and sending out certain cryes, . . .\\nand when they obeyed me not . . . I would fall into a rage, and that\\nnot against such as were my subjects or servants, but against my Elders\\nand my betters, and I would revenge myself upon them by crying.\" He has\\nobserved that infants \"begin to laugh, first sleeping, and then shortly\\nwaking;\" a curious note, but he does not ask wherefore the sense of\\nhumour, or the expression of it, comes to children first in their\\nslumber. Of what do babies dream? And what do the nested swallows\\nchirrup to each other in their sleep?\\n\"Such have I understood that such infants are as I could know, and such\\nhave I been told that I was by them who brought me up, though even they\\nmay rather be accounted not to know, than to know these things.\" One\\nthing he knows, \"that even infancy is subject to sin.\" From the womb we\\nare touched with evil. \"Myselfe have seene and observed some little\\nchild, who could not speake; and yet he was all in an envious kind of\\nwrath, looking pale with a bitter countenance upon his foster-brother.\"\\nIn an envious kind of wrath! Is it not the motive of half our politics,\\nand too much of our criticism? Such is man\\'s inborn nature, not to be\\ncured by laws or reforms, not to be washed out of his veins, though\\n\"blood be shed like rain, and tears like a mist.\" For \"an infant cannot\\nendure a companion to feed with him in a fountain of milk which is richly\\nabounding and overflowing, although that companion be wholly destitute,\\nand can take no other food but that.\" This is the Original Sin,\\ninherited, innate, unacquired; for this are \"babes span-long\" to suffer,\\nas the famous or infamous preacher declared. \"Where, or at what time,\\nwas I ever innocent?\" he cries, and hears no answer from \"the dark\\nbackward and abysm\" of the pre-natal life.\\nThen the Saint describes a child\\'s learning to speak; how he amasses\\nverbal tokens of things, \"having tamed, and, as it were, broken my mouth\\nto the pronouncing of them.\" \"And so I began to launch out more deeply\\ninto the tempestuous traffique and society of mankind.\" Tempestuous\\nenough he found or made it--this child of a Pagan father and a Christian\\nsaint, Monica, the saint of Motherhood. The past generations had\\n\"chalked out certain laborious ways of learning,\" and, perhaps, Saint\\nAugustine never forgave the flogging pedagogue--the _plagosus Orbilius_\\nof his boyhood. Long before his day he had found out that the sorrows of\\nchildren, and their joys, are no less serious than the sorrows of mature\\nage. \"Is there, Lord, any man of so great a mind that he can think\\nlightly of those racks, and hooks, and other torments, for the avoiding\\nwhereof men pray unto Thee with great fear from one end of the world to\\nthe other, as that he can make sport at such as doe most sharply inflict\\nthese things upon them, as our parents laughed at the torments which we\\nchildren susteyned at our master\\'s hands?\" Can we suppose that Monica\\nlaughed, or was it only the heathen father who approved of \"roughing it?\"\\n\"Being yet a childe, I began to beg Thy ayde and succour; and I did\\nloosen the knots of my tongue in praying Thee; and I begged, being yet a\\nlittle one, with no little devotion, that I might not be beaten at the\\nschoole.\" One is reminded of Tom Tulliver, who gave up even praying that\\nhe might learn one part of his work: \"Please make Mr. --- say that I am\\nnot to do mathematics.\"\\nThe Saint admits that he lacked neither memory nor wit, \"but he took\\ndelight in playing.\" \"The plays and toys of men are called business,\\nyet, when children fall unto them, the same men punish them.\" Yet the\\nschoolmaster was \"more fed upon by rage,\" if beaten in any little\\nquestion of learning, than the boy; \"if in any match at Ball I had been\\nmaistered by one of my playfellows.\" He \"aspired proudly to be\\nvictorious in the matches which he made,\" and I seriously regret to say\\nthat he would buy a match, and pay his opponent to lose when he could not\\nwin fairly. He liked romances also, \"to have myne eares scratched with\\nlying fables\"--a \"lazy, idle boy,\" like him who dallied with Rebecca and\\nRowena in the holidays of Charter House.\\nSaint Augustine, like Sir Walter Scott at the University of Edinburgh,\\nwas \"The Greek Dunce.\" Both of these great men, to their sorrow and\\nloss, absolutely and totally declined to learn Greek. \"But what the\\nreason was why I hated the Greeke language, while I was taught it, being\\na child, I do not yet understand.\" The Saint was far from being alone in\\nthat distaste, and he who writes loathed Greek like poison--till he came\\nto Homer. Latin the Saint loved, except \"when reading, writing, and\\ncasting of accounts was taught in Latin, which I held not for lesse\\npaynefull or penal than the very Greeke. I wept for Dido\\'s death, who\\nmade herselfe away with the sword,\" he declares, \"and even so, the saying\\nthat two and two makes foure was an ungrateful song in mine ears; whereas\\nthe wooden horse full of armed men, the burning of Troy, and the very\\nGhost of Creusa, was a most delightful spectacle of vanity.\"\\nIn short, the Saint was a regular Boy--a high-spirited, clever, sportive,\\nand wilful creature. He was as fond as most boys of the mythical tales,\\n\"and for that I was accounted to be a towardly boy.\" Meanwhile he does\\nnot record that Monica disliked his learning the foolish dear old heathen\\nfables--\"that flood of hell!\"\\nBoyhood gave place to youth, and, allowing for the vanity of\\nself-accusation, there can be little doubt that the youth of Saint\\nAugustine was _une jeunesse orageuse_. \"And what was that wherein I took\\ndelight but to love and to be beloved.\" There was ever much sentiment\\nand affection in his amours, but his soul \"could not distinguish the\\nbeauty of chast love from the muddy darkness of lust. Streams of them\\ndid confusedly boyl in me\"--in his African veins. \"With a restless kind\\nof weariness\" he pursued that Other Self of the Platonic dream,\\nneglecting the Love of God:\\n \"Oh, how late art thou come, O my Joy!\"\\nThe course of his education--for the Bar, as we should say--carried him\\nfrom home to Carthage, where he rapidly forgot the pure counsels of his\\nmother \"as old wife\\'s consailes.\" \"And we delighted in doing ill, not\\nonly for the pleasure of the fact, but even for the affection of prayse.\"\\nEven Monica, it seems, justified the saying:\\n \"Every woman is at heart a Rake.\"\\nMarriage would have been his making, Saint Augustine says, \"but she\\ndesired not even that so very much, lest the cloggs of a wife might have\\nhindered her hopes of me . . . In the meantime the reins were loosed to\\nme beyond reason.\" Yet the sin which he regrets most bitterly was\\nnothing more dreadful than the robbery of an orchard! Pears he had in\\nplenty, none the less he went, with a band of roisterers, and pillaged\\nanother man\\'s pear tree. \"I loved the sin, not that which I obtained by\\nthe same, but I loved the sin itself.\" There lay the sting of it! They\\nwere not even unusually excellent pears. \"A Peare tree ther was, neere\\nour vineyard, heavy loaden with fruite, which tempted not greatly either\\nthe sight or tast. To the shaking and robbing thereof, certaine most\\nwicked youthes (whereof I was one) went late at night. We carried away\\nhuge burthens of fruit from thence, not for our owne eating, but to be\\ncast before the hoggs.\"\\nOh, moonlit night of Africa, and orchard by these wild seabanks where\\nonce Dido stood; oh, laughter of boys among the shaken leaves, and sound\\nof falling fruit; how do you live alone out of so many nights that no man\\nremembers? For Carthage is destroyed, indeed, and forsaken of the sea,\\nyet that one hour of summer is to be unforgotten while man has memory of\\nthe story of his past.\\nNothing of this, to be sure, is in the mind of the Saint, but a long\\nremorse for this great sin, which he earnestly analyses. Nor is he so\\npenitent but that he is clear-sighted, and finds the spring of his mis-\\ndoing in the Sense of Humour! \"It was a delight and laughter which\\ntickled us, even at the very hart, to find that we were upon the point of\\ndeceiving them who feared no such thing from us, and who, if they had\\nknown it, would earnestly have procured the contrary.\"\\nSaint Augustine admits that he lived with a fast set, as people say\\nnow--\"the Depravers\" or \"Destroyers\"; though he loved them little, \"whose\\nactions I ever did abhor, that is, their Destruction of others, amongst\\nwhom I yet lived with a kind of shameless bashfulness.\" In short, the\\n\"Hell-Fire Club\" of that day numbered a reluctant Saint among its\\nmembers! It was no Christian gospel, but the Hortensius of Cicero which\\nwon him from this perilous society. \"It altered my affection, and made\\nme address my prayers to Thee, O Lord, and gave me other desires and\\npurposes than I had before. All vain hopes did instantly grow base in\\nmyne eyes, and I did, with an incredible heat of hart, aspire towards the\\nImmortality of Wisdom.\" Thus it was really \"Saint Tully,\" and not the\\nmystic call of _Tolle_! _Lege_! that \"converted\" Augustine, diverting the\\ncurrent of his life into the channel of Righteousness. \"How was I\\nkindled then, oh, my God, with a desire to fly from earthly things\\ntowards Thee.\"\\nThere now remained only the choice of a Road. Saint Augustine dates his\\nown conversion from the day of his turning to the strait Christian\\northodoxy. Even the Platonic writings, had he known Greek, would not\\nhave satisfied his desire. \"For where was that Charity that buildeth\\nupon the foundation of Humility, which is Christ Jesus? . . . These\\npages\" (of the Platonists) \"carried not in them this countenance of\\npiety--the tears of confession, and that sacrifice of Thine which is an\\nafflicted spirit, a contrite and humbled heart, the salvation of Thy\\npeople, the Spouse, the City, the pledge of Thy Holy Spirit, the Cup of\\nour Redemption. No man doth there thus express himself. Shall not my\\nsoul be subject to God, for of Him is my salvation? For He is my God,\\nand my salvation, my protectour; I shall never be moved. No man doth\\nthere once call and say to him: \\'Come unto me all you that labour.\\'\"\\nThe heathen doctors had not the grace which Saint Augustine instinctively\\nknew he lacked--the grace of Humility, nor the Comfort that is not from\\nwithin but from without. To these he aspired; let us follow him on the\\npath by which he came within their influence; but let us not forget that\\nthe guide on the way to the City was kind, clever, wordy, vain old Marcus\\nTullius Cicero. It is to the City that all our faces should be set, if\\nwe knew what belongs to our peace; thither we cast fond, hopeless,\\nbackward glances, even if we be of those whom Tertullian calls \"Saint\\nSatan\\'s Penitents.\" Here, in Augustine, we meet a man who found the\\npath--one of the few who have found it, of the few who have won that Love\\nwhich is our only rest. It may be worth while to follow him to the\\njourney\\'s end.\\nThe treatise of Cicero, then, inflamed Augustine \"to the loving and\\nseeking and finding and holding and inseparably embracing of wisdom\\nitself, wheresoever it was.\" Yet, when he looked for wisdom in the\\nChristian Scriptures, all the literary man, the rhetorician in him, was\\nrepelled by the simplicity of the style. Without going further than Mr.\\nPater\\'s book, \"Marius, the Epicurean,\" and his account of Apuleius, an\\nEnglish reader may learn what kind of style a learned African of that\\ndate found not too simple. But Cicero, rather than Apuleius, was\\nAugustine\\'s ideal; that verbose and sonorous eloquence captivated him, as\\nit did the early scholars when learning revived. Augustine had dallied a\\nlittle with the sect of the Manichees, which appears to have grieved his\\nmother more than his wild life.\\nBut she was comforted by a vision, when she found herself in a wood, and\\nmet \"a glorious young man,\" who informed her that \"where she was there\\nshould her son be also.\" Curious it is to think that this very semblance\\nof a glorious young man haunts the magical dreams of heathen Red Indians,\\nadvising them where they shall find game, and was beheld in such\\necstasies by John Tanner, a white man who lived with the Indians, and\\nadopted their religion. The Greeks would have called this appearance\\nHermes, even in this guise Odysseus met him in the oak wood of Circe\\'s\\nIsle. But Augustine was not yet in his mother\\'s faith; he still taught\\nand studied rhetoric, contending for its prizes, but declining to be\\naided by a certain wizard of his acquaintance. He had entered as a\\ncompetitor for a \"Tragicall poeme,\" but was too sportsmanlike to seek\\nvictory by art necromantic. Yet he followed after Astrologers, because\\nthey used no sacrifices, and did not pretend to consult spirits. Even\\nthe derision of his dear friend Nebridius could not then move him from\\nthose absurd speculations. His friend died, and \"his whole heart was\\ndarkened;\" \"mine eyes would be looking for him in all places, but they\\nfound him not, and I hated all things because they told me no news of\\nhim.\" He fell into an extreme weariness of life, and no less fear of\\ndeath. He lived but by halves; having lost _dimidium animae suae_, and\\nyet dreaded death, \"Lest he might chance to have wholy dyed whome I\\nextremely loved.\" So he returned to Carthage for change, and sought\\npleasure in other friendships; but \"Blessed is the man that loves Thee\\nand his friend in Thee and his enemy for Thee. For he only never loseth\\na dear friend to whom all men are dear, for His sake, who is never lost.\"\\nHere, on the margin of the old book, beside these thoughts, so beautiful\\nif so helpless, like all words, to console, some reader long dead has\\nwritten:--\\n \"Pray for your poor servant, J. M.\"\\nAnd again,\\n \"Pray for your poor friend.\"\\nDoubtless, some Catholic reader, himself bereaved, is imploring the\\nprayers of a dear friend dead; and sure we need their petitions more than\\nthey need ours, who have left this world of temptation, and are at peace.\\nAfter this loss Saint Augustine went to Rome, his ambition urging him,\\nperhaps, but more his disgust with the violent and riotous life of\\nstudents in Carthage. To leave his mother was difficult, but \"I lyed to\\nmy mother, yea, such a mother, and so escaped from her.\" And now he had\\na dangerous sickness, and afterwards betook himself to converse with the\\northodox, for example at Milan with Saint Ambrose. In Milan his mother\\nwould willingly have continued in the African ritual--a Pagan\\nsurvival--carrying wine and food to the graves of the dead; but this\\nSaint Ambrose forbade, and she obeyed him for him \"she did extremely\\naffect for the regard of my spirituall good.\"\\nFrom Milan his friend Alipius preceded him to Rome, and there \"was\\ndamnably delighted\" with the gladiatorial combats, being \"made drunk with\\na delight in blood.\" Augustine followed him to Rome, and there lost the\\ngirl of his heart, \"so that my heart was wounded, as that the very blood\\ndid follow.\" The lady had made a vow of eternal chastity, \"having left\\nme with a son by her.\" But he fell to a new love as the old one was\\ndeparted, and yet the ancient wound pained him still \"after a more\\ndesperate and dogged manner.\"\\n_Haeret letalis arundo_!\\nBy these passions his conversion was delayed, the carnal and spiritual\\nwills fighting against each other within him. \"Give me chastity and\\ncontinency, O Lord,\" he would pray, \"but do not give it yet,\" and perhaps\\nthis is the frankest of the confessions of Saint Augustine. In the midst\\nof this war of the spirit and the flesh, \"Behold I heard a voyce, as if\\nit had been of some boy or girl from some house not farre off, uttering\\nand often repeating these words in a kind of singing voice,\\n \"_Tolle, Lege; Tolle, Lege_,\\n Take up and read, take up and read.\"\\nSo he took up a Testament, and, opening it at random, after the manner of\\nhis Virgilian lots, read:--\\n\"Not in surfeiting and wantonness, not in causality and uncleanness,\"\\nwith what follows. \"Neither would I read any further, neither was there\\nany cause why I should.\" Saint Augustine does not, perhaps, mean us to\\nunderstand (as his translator does), that he was \"miraculously called.\"\\nHe knew what was right perfectly well before; the text only clinched a\\nresolve which he has found it very hard to make. Perhaps there was a\\ntrifle of superstition in the matter. We never know how superstitious we\\nare. At all events, henceforth \"I neither desired a wife, nor had I any\\nambitious care of any worldly thing.\" He told his mother, and Monica\\nrejoiced, believing that now her prayers were answered.\\nSuch is the story of the conversion of Saint Augustine. It was the\\nmaturing of an old purpose, and long deferred. Much stranger stories are\\ntold of Bunyan and Colonel Gardiner. He gave up rhetoric; another man\\nwas engaged \"to sell words\" to the students of Milan. Being now\\nconverted, the Saint becomes less interesting, except for his account of\\nhis mother\\'s death, and of that ecstatic converse they held \"she and I\\nalone, leaning against a window, which had a prospect upon the garden of\\nour lodging at Ostia.\" They\\n \"Came on that which is, and heard\\n The vast pulsations of the world.\"\\n\"And whilest we thus spake, and panted towards the divine, we grew able\\nto take a little taste thereof, with the whole strife of our hearts, and\\nwe sighed profoundly, and left there, confined, the very top and flower\\nof our souls and spirits; and we returned to the noyse of language again,\\nwhere words are begun and ended.\"\\nThen Monica fell sick to death, and though she had ever wished to lie\\nbeside her husband in Africa, she said: \"Lay this Body where you will.\\nLet not any care of it disquiet you; only this I entreat, that you will\\nremember me at the altar of the Lord, wheresoever you be.\" \"But upon the\\nninth day of her sickness, in the six-and-fiftieth year of her age, and\\nthe three-and-thirtieth of mine, that religious and pious soul was\\ndischarged from the prison of her body.\"\\nThe grief of Augustine was not less keen, it seems, than it had been at\\nthe death of his friend. But he could remember how \"she related with\\ngreat dearness of affection, how she never heard any harsh or unkind word\\nto be darted out of my mouth against her.\" And to this consolation was\\nadded who knows what of confidence and tenderness of certain hope, or a\\nkind of deadness, perhaps, that may lighten the pain of a heart very\\noften tried and inured to every pain. For it is certain that \"this green\\nwound\" was green and grievous for a briefer time than the agony of his\\nearlier sorrows. He himself, so earnest in analysing his own emotions,\\nis perplexed by the short date of his tears, and his sharpest grief: \"Let\\nhim read it who will, and interpret it as it pleaseth him.\"\\nSo, with the death of Monica, we may leave Saint Augustine. The most\\nhuman of books, the \"Confessions,\" now strays into theology. Of all\\nbooks that which it most oddly resembles, to my fancy at least, is the\\npoems of Catullus. The passion and the tender heart they have in common,\\nand in common the war of flesh and spirit; the shameful inappeasable love\\nof Lesbia, or of the worldly life; so delightful and dear to the poet and\\nto the saint, so despised in other moods conquered and victorious again,\\namong the battles of the war in our members. The very words in which the\\nVeronese and the Bishop of Hippo described the pleasure and gaiety of an\\nearly friendship are almost the same, and we feel that, born four hundred\\nyears later, the lover of Lesbia, the singer of Sirmio might actually\\nhave found peace in religion, and exchanged the earthly for the heavenly\\nlove.\\nCHAPTER IX: SMOLLETT\\nThe great English novelists of the eighteenth century turned the course\\nof English Literature out of its older channel. Her streams had\\ndescended from the double peaks of Parnassus to irrigate the enamelled\\nfields and elegant parterres of poetry and the drama, as the critics of\\nthe period might have said. But Richardson, Fielding, Smollett, and\\nSterne, diverted the waters, from poetry and plays, into the region of\\nthe novel, whither they have brought down a copious alluvial deposit.\\nModern authors do little but till this fertile Delta: the drama is now in\\nthe desert, poetry is a drug, and fiction is literature. Among the\\nwriters who made this revolution, Smollett is, personally, the least well\\nknown to the world, despite the great part which autobiography and\\nconfessions play in his work. He is always talking about himself, and\\nintroducing his own experiences. But there is little evidence from\\nwithout; his extant correspondence is scanty; he was not in Dr. Johnson\\'s\\ncircle, much less was he in that of Horace Walpole. He was not a popular\\nman, and probably he has long ceased to be a popular author. About 1780\\nthe vendors of children\\'s books issued abridgments of \"Tom Jones\" and\\n\"Pamela,\" \"Clarissa\" and \"Joseph Andrews,\" adapted to the needs of infant\\nminds. It was a curious enterprise, certainly, but the booksellers do\\nnot seem to have produced \"Every Boy\\'s Roderick Random,\" or \"Peregrine\\nPickle for the Young.\" Smollett, in short, is less known than Fielding\\nand Sterne, even Thackeray says but a word about him, in the \"English\\nHumorists,\" and he has no place in the series of \"English Men of\\nLetters.\"\\nWhat we know of Smollett reveals a thoroughly typical Scot of his period;\\na Scot of the species absolutely opposed to Sir Pertinax Macsycophant,\\nand rather akin to the species of Robert Burns. \"Rather akin,\" we may\\nsay, for Smollett, like Burns, was a humorist, and in his humour far from\\ndainty; he was a personal satirist, and a satirist far from chivalrous.\\nLike Burns, too, he was a poet of independence; like Burns, and even more\\nthan Burns, in a time of patronage he was recalcitrant against patrons.\\nBut, unlike Burns, he was _farouche_ to an extreme degree; and, unlike\\nBurns, he carried very far his prejudices about his \"gentrice,\" his\\ngentle birth. Herein he is at the opposite pole from the great peasant\\npoet.\\nTwo potent characteristics of his country were at war within him. There\\nwas, first, the belief in \"gentrice,\" in a natural difference of kind\\nbetween men of coat armour and men without it. Thus Roderick Random, the\\nstarving cadet of a line of small lairds, accepts the almost incredible\\nself-denial and devotion of Strap as merely his due. Prince Charles\\ncould not have taken the devotion of Henry Goring, or of Neil MacEachain,\\nmore entirely as a matter of course, involving no consideration in\\nreturn, than Roderick took the unparalleled self-sacrifice of his barber\\nfriend and school-mate. Scott has remarked on this contemptuous and\\nungrateful selfishness, and has contrasted it with the relations of Tom\\nJones and Partridge. Of course, it is not to be assumed that Smollett\\nwould have behaved like Roderick, when, \"finding the fire in my apartment\\nalmost extinguished, I vented my fury upon poor Strap, whose ear I\\npinched with such violence that he roared hideously with pain . . . \" To\\nbe sure Roderick presently \"felt unspeakable remorse . . . foamed at the\\nmouth, and kicked the chairs about the room.\" Now Strap had rescued\\nRoderick from starvation, had bestowed on him hundreds of pounds, and had\\ncarried his baggage, and dined on his leavings. But Strap was not gently\\nborn! Smollett would not, probably, have acted thus, but he did not\\nconsider such conduct a thing out of nature.\\nOn the other side was Smollett\\'s Scottish spirit of independence. As\\nearly as 1515, James Ingles, chaplain of Margaret Tudor, wrote to Adam\\nWilliamson, \"You know the use of this country. . . . The man hath more\\nwords than the master, and will not be content except he know the\\nmaster\\'s counsel. There is no order among us.\" Strap had the instinct\\nof feudal loyalty to a descendant of a laird. But Smollett boasts that,\\nbeing at the time about twenty, and having burdened a nobleman with his\\nimpossible play, \"The Regicide,\" \"resolved to punish his barbarous\\nindifference, and actually discarded my Patron.\" _He_ was not given to\\n\"booing\" (in the sense of bowing), but had, of all known Scots, the most\\n\"canty conceit o\\' himsel\\'.\" These qualities, with a violence of temper\\nwhich took the form of beating people when on his travels, cannot have\\nmade Smollett a popular character. He knew his faults, as he shows in\\nthe dedication of \"Ferdinand, Count Fathom,\" to himself. \"I have known\\nyou trifling, superficial, and obstinate in dispute; meanly jealous and\\nawkwardly reserved; rash and haughty in your resentment; and coarse and\\nlowly in your connections.\"\\nHe could, it is true, on occasion, forgive (even where he had not been\\nwronged), and could compensate, in milder moods, for the fierce attacks\\nmade in hours when he was \"meanly jealous.\" Yet, in early life at least,\\nhe regarded his own Roderick Random as \"modest and meritorious,\"\\nstruggling nobly with the difficulties which beset a \"friendless orphan,\"\\nespecially from the \"selfishness, envy, malice, and base indifference of\\nmankind.\" Roderick himself is, in fact, the incarnation of the basest\\nselfishness. In one of his adventures he is guilty of that extreme\\ninfamy which the d\\'Artagnan of \"The Three Musketeers\" and of the\\n\"Memoirs\" committed, and for which the d\\'Artagnan of _Le Vicomte de\\nBragelonne_ took shame to himself. While engaged in a virtuous passion,\\nRoderick not only behaves like a vulgar debauchee, but pursues the\\nmeanest arts of the fortune-hunter who is ready to marry any woman for\\nher money. Such is the modest and meritorious orphan, and mankind now\\ncarries its \"base indifference\" so far, that Smollett\\'s biographer, Mr.\\nHannay, says, \"if Roderick had been hanged, I, for my part, should have\\nheard the tidings unmoved . . . Smollett obviously died without realising\\nhow nearly the hero, who was in some sort a portrait of himself, came to\\nbeing a ruffian.\"\\nDr. Carlyle, in 1758, being in London, found Smollett \"much of a\\nhumorist, and not to be put out of his way.\" A \"humorist,\" here, means\\nan overbearingly eccentric person, such as Smollett, who lived much in a\\nsociety of literary dependants, was apt to become. But Dr. Carlyle also\\nfound that, though Smollett \"described so well the characters of ruffians\\nand profligates,\" he did not resemble them. Dr. Robertson, the\\nhistorian, \"expressed great surprise at his polished and agreeable\\nmanners, and the great urbanity of his conversation.\" He was handsome in\\nperson, as his portrait shows, but his \"nervous system was exceedingly\\nirritable and subject to passion,\" as he says in the Latin account of his\\nhealth which, in 1763, he drew up for the physician at Montpellier.\\nThough, when he chose, he could behave like a man of breeding, and though\\nhe undeniably had a warm heart for his wife and daughter, he did not\\nalways choose to behave well. Except Dr. Moore, his biographer, he seems\\nto have had few real friends during most of his career.\\nAs to persons whom he chose to regard as his enemies, he was beyond\\nmeasure rancorous and dangerous. From his first patron, Lord Lyttelton,\\nto his last, he pursued them with unscrupulous animosity. If he did not\\nmean actually to draw portraits of his grandfather, his cousins, his\\nschool-master, and the apothecary whose gallipots he attended--in\\n\"Roderick Random,\"--yet he left the originals who suggested his\\ncharacters in a very awkward situation. For assuredly he did entertain a\\nspite against his grandfather: and as many of the incidents in \"Roderick\\nRandom\" were autobiographical, the public readily inferred that others\\nwere founded on fact.\\nThe outlines of Smollett\\'s career are familiar, though gaps in our\\nknowledge occur. Perhaps they may partly be filled up by the aid of\\npassages in his novels, plays, and poems: in these, at all events, he\\ndescribes conditions and situations through which he himself may, or\\nmust, have passed.\\nBorn in 1721, he was a younger son of Archibald, a younger son of Sir\\nJames Smollett of Bonhill, a house on the now polluted Leven, between\\nLoch Lomond and the estuary of the Clyde. Smollett\\'s father made an\\nimprudent marriage: the grandfather provided a small, but competent\\nprovision for him and his family, during his own life. The father,\\nArchibald, died; the grandfather left nothing to the mother of Tobias and\\nher children, but they were assisted with scrimp decency by the heirs.\\nHence the attacks on the grandfather and cousins of Roderick Random: but,\\nlater, Smollett returned to kinder feelings.\\nIn some ways Tobias resembled his old grandsire. About 1710 that\\ngentleman wrote a Memoir of his own life. Hence we learn that _he_, in\\nchildhood, like Roderick Random, was regarded as \"a clog and burden,\" and\\nwas neglected by his father, ill-used by his step-mother. Thus Tobias\\nhad not only his own early poverty to resent, but had a hereditary grudge\\nagainst fortune, and \"the base indifference of mankind.\" The old\\ngentleman was lodged \"with very hard and penurious people,\" at Glasgow\\nUniversity. He rose in the world, and was a good Presbyterian Whig, but\\n\"had no liberty\" to help to forfeit James II. \"The puir child, his son\"\\n(James III. and VIII.), \"if he was really such, was innocent, and it were\\nhard to do anything that would touch the son for the father\\'s fault.\" The\\nold gentleman, therefore, though a Member of Parliament, evaded attending\\nthe first Parliament after the Union: \"I had no freedom to do it, because\\nI understood that the great business to be agitated therein was to make\\nlaws for abjuring the Pretender . . . which I could not go in with, being\\nalways of opinion that it was hard to impose oaths on people who had not\\nfreedom to take them.\"\\nThis was uncommonly liberal conduct, in a Whig, and our Smollett, though\\nno Jacobite, was in distinct and courageous sympathy with Jacobite\\nScotland. Indeed, he was as patriotic as Burns, or as his own Lismahago.\\nThese were times, we must remember, in which Scottish patriotism was more\\nthan a mere historical sentiment. Scotland was inconceivably poor, and\\nScots, in England, were therefore ridiculous. The country had, so far,\\ngained very little by the Union, and the Union was detested even by\\nScottish Whig Earls. It is recorded by Moore that, while at the\\nDumbarton Grammar School, Smollett wrote \"verses to the memory of\\nWallace, of whom he became an early admirer,\" having read \"Blind Harry\\'s\\ntranslation of the Latin poems of John Blair,\" chaplain to that hero.\\nThere probably never were any such Latin poems, but Smollett began with\\nthe same hero-worship as Burns. He had the attachment of a Scot to his\\nnative stream, the Leven, which later he was to celebrate. Now if\\nSmollett had credited Roderick Random with these rural, poetical, and\\npatriotic tastes, his hero would have been much more human and amiable.\\nThere was much good in Smollett which is absent in Random. But for some\\nreason, probably because Scotland was unpopular after the Forty-Five,\\nSmollett merely describes the woes, ill usage, and retaliations of\\nRoderick. That he suffered as Random did is to the last degree\\nimprobable. He had a fair knowledge of Latin, and was not destitute of\\nGreek, while his master, a Mr. Love, bore a good character both for\\nhumanity and scholarship. He must have studied the classics at Glasgow\\nUniversity, where he was apprenticed to Mr. Gordon, a surgeon. Gordon,\\nagain, was an excellent man, appreciated by Smollett himself in after\\ndays, and the odious Potion of \"Roderick Random\" must, like his rival,\\nCrab, have been merely a fancy sketch of meanness, hypocrisy, and\\nprofligacy. Perhaps the good surgeon became the victim of that \"one\\ncontinued string of epigrammatic sarcasms,\" such as Mr. Colquhoun told\\nRamsay of Ochtertyre, Smollett used to play off on his companions, \"for\\nwhich no talents could compensate.\" Judging by Dr. Carlyle\\'s Memoirs\\nthis intolerable kind of display was not unusual in Caledonian\\nconversation: but it was not likely to make Tobias popular in England.\\nThither he went in 1739, with very little money, \"and a very large\\nassortment of letters of recommendation: whether his relatives intended\\nto compensate for the scantiness of the one by their profusion in the\\nother is uncertain; but he has often been heard to declare that their\\nliberality in the last article was prodigious.\" The Smolletts were not\\n\"kinless loons\"; they had connections: but who, in Scotland, had money?\\nTobias had passed his medical examinations, but he rather trusted in his\\nMS. tragedy, \"The Regicide.\" Tragical were its results for the author.\\nInspired by George Buchanan\\'s Latin history of Scotland, Smollett had\\nproduced a play, in blank verse, on the murder of James I. That a boy,\\neven a Scottish boy, should have an overweening passion for this unlucky\\npiece, that he should expect by such a work to climb a step on fortune\\'s\\nladder, is nowadays amazing. For ten years he clung to it, modified it,\\npolished, improved it, and then published it in 1749, after the success\\nof \"Roderick Random.\" Twice he told the story of his theatrical mishaps\\nand disappointments, which were such as occur to every writer for the\\nstage. He wailed over them in \"Roderick Random,\" in the story of Mr.\\nMelopoyn; he prolonged his cry, in the preface to \"The Regicide,\" and\\nprobably the noble whom he \"lashed\" (very indecently) in his two satires\\n(\"Advice,\" 1746, \"Reproof,\" 1747, and in \"Roderick Random\") was the\\npatron who could not get the tragedy acted. First, in 1739, he had a\\npatron whom he \"discarded.\" Then he went to the West Indies, and,\\nreturning in 1744, he lugged out his tragedy again, and fell foul again\\nof patrons, actors, and managers. What befell him was the common fate.\\nPeople did not, probably, hasten to read his play: managers and\\n\"supercilious peers\" postponed that entertainment, or, at least, the\\nnoblemen could not make the managers accept it if they did not want it.\\nOur taste differs so much from that of the time which admired Home\\'s\\n\"Douglas,\" and \"The Regicide\" was so often altered to meet objections,\\nthat we can scarcely criticise it. Of course it is absolutely\\nunhistorical; of course it is empty of character, and replete with\\nfustian, and ineffably tedious; but perhaps it is not much worse than\\nother luckier tragedies of the age. Naturally a lover calls his wounded\\nlady \"the bleeding fair.\" Naturally she exclaims--\\n \"Celestial powers\\n Protect my father, shower upon his--oh!\" (Dies).\\nNaturally her adorer answers with--\\n \"So may our mingling souls\\n To bliss supernal wing our happy--oh!\" (Dies).\\nWe are reminded of--\\n \"Alas, my Bom!\" (Dies).\\n \"\\'Bastes\\' he would have said!\"\\nThe piece, if presented, must have been damned. But Smollett was so\\nangry with one patron, Lord Lyttelton, that he burlesqued the poor man\\'s\\ndirge on the death of his wife. He was so angry with Garrick that he\\ndragged him into \"Roderick Random\" as Marmozet. Later, obliged by\\nGarrick, and forgiving Lyttelton, he wrote respectfully about both. But,\\nin 1746 (in \"Advice\"), he had assailed the \"proud lord, who smiles a\\ngracious lie,\" and \"the varnished ruffians of the State.\" Because\\nTobias\\'s play was unacted, people who tried to aid him were liars and\\nruffians, and a great deal worse, for in his satire, as in his first\\nnovel, Smollett charges men of high rank with the worst of unnamable\\ncrimes. Pollio and Lord Strutwell, whoever they may have been, were\\nprobably recognisable then, and were undeniably libelled, though they did\\nnot appeal to a jury. It is improbable that Sir John Cope had ever tried\\nto oblige Smollett. His ignoble attack on Cope, after that unfortunate\\nGeneral had been fairly and honourably acquitted of incompetence and\\ncowardice, was, then, wholly disinterested. Cope is \"a courtier Ape,\\nappointed General.\"\\n \"Then Pug, aghast, fled faster than the wind,\\n Nor deign\\'d, in three-score miles, to look behind;\\n While every band for orders bleat in vain,\\n And fall in slaughtered heaps upon the plain,\"--\\nof Preston Pans.\\nNothing could be more remote from the truth, or more unjustly cruel.\\nSmollett had not here even the excuse of patriotism. Sir John Cope was\\nno Butcher Cumberland. In fact the poet\\'s friend is not wrong, when, in\\n\"Reproof,\" he calls Smollett \"a flagrant misanthrope.\" The world was out\\nof joint for the cadet of Bonhill: both before and after his very trying\\nexperiences as a ship surgeon the managers would not accept \"The\\nRegicide.\" This was reason good why Smollett should try to make a little\\nmoney and notoriety by penning satires. They are fierce, foul-mouthed,\\nand pointless. But Smollett was poor, and he was angry; he had the\\nexamples of Pope and Swift before him; which, as far as truculence went,\\nhe could imitate. Above all, it was then the fixed belief of men of\\nletters that some peer or other ought to aid and support them; and, as no\\npeer did support Smollett, obviously they were \"varnished ruffians.\" He\\nerred as he would not err now, for times, and ways of going wrong, are\\nchanged. But, at best, how different are his angry couplets from the\\nlofty melancholy of Johnson\\'s satires!\\nSmollett\\'s \"small sum of money\" did not permit him long to push the\\nfortunes of his tragedy, in 1739; and as for his \"very large assortment\\nof letters of recommendation,\" they only procured for him the post of\\nsurgeon\\'s mate in the _Cumberland_ of the line. Here he saw enough of\\nthe horrors of naval life, enough of misery, brutality, and\\nmismanagement, at Carthagena (1741), to supply materials for the salutary\\nand sickening pages on that theme in \"Roderick Random.\" He also saw and\\nappreciated the sterling qualities of courage, simplicity, and\\ngenerosity, which he has made immortal in his Bowlings and Trunnions.\\nIt is part of a novelist\\'s business to make one half of the world know\\nhow the other half lives; and in this province Smollett anticipated\\nDickens. He left the service as soon as he could, when the beaten fleet\\nwas refitting at Jamaica. In that isle he seems to have practised as a\\ndoctor; and he married, or was betrothed to, a Miss Lascelles, who had a\\nsmall and far from valuable property. The real date of his marriage is\\nobscure: more obscure are Smollett\\'s resources on his return to London,\\nin 1744. Houses in Downing Street can never have been cheap, but we find\\n\"Mr. Smollett, surgeon in Downing Street, Westminster,\" and, in 1746, he\\nwas living in May Fair, not a region for slender purses. His tragedy was\\nnow bringing in nothing but trouble, to himself and others. His satires\\ncannot have been lucrative. As a dweller in May Fair he could not\\nsupport himself, like his Mr. Melopoyn, by writing ballads for street\\nsingers. Probably he practised in his profession. In \"Count Fathom\" he\\nmakes his adventurer \"purchase an old chariot, which was new painted for\\nthe occasion, and likewise hire a footman . . . This equipage, though\\nmuch more expensive than his finances could bear, he found absolutely\\nnecessary to give him a chance of employment . . . A walking physician\\nwas considered as an obscure pedlar.\" A chariot, Smollett insists, was\\nnecessary to \"every raw surgeon\"; while Bob Sawyer\\'s expedient of \"being\\ncalled from church\" was already _vieux jeu_, in the way of advertisement.\\nSuch things had been \"injudiciously hackneyed.\" In this passage of\\nFathom\\'s adventures, Smollett proclaims his insight into methods of\\ngetting practice. A physician must ingratiate himself with apothecaries\\nand ladies\\' maids, or \"acquire interest enough\" to have an infirmary\\nerected \"by the voluntary subscriptions of his friends.\" Here Smollett\\ndenounces hospitals, which \"encourage the vulgar to be idle and\\ndissolute, by opening an asylum to them and their families, from the\\ndiseases of poverty and intemperance.\" This is odd morality for one who\\nsuffered from \"the base indifference of mankind.\" He ought to have known\\nthat poverty is not a vice for which the poor are to be blamed; and that\\nintemperance is not the only other cause of their diseases. Perhaps the\\nunfeeling passage is a mere paradox in the style of his own Lismahago.\\nWith or without a chariot, it is probable that Tobias had not an\\ninsinuating style, or \"a good bedside manner\"; friends to support a\\nhospital for his renown he had none; but, somehow, he could live in May\\nFair, and, in 1746, could meet Dr. Carlyle and Stewart, son of the\\nProvost of Edinburgh, and other Scots, at the Golden Ball in Cockspur\\nStreet. There they were enjoying \"a frugal supper and a little punch,\"\\nwhen the news of Culloden arrived. Carlyle had been a Whig volunteer:\\nhe, probably, was happy enough; but Stewart, whose father was in prison,\\ngrew pale, and left the room. Smollett and Carlyle then walked home\\nthrough secluded streets, and were silent, lest their speech should\\nbewray them for Scots. \"John Bull,\" quoth Smollett, \"is as haughty and\\nvaliant to-day, as he was abject and cowardly on the Black Wednesday when\\nthe Highlanders were at Derby.\"\\n\"Weep, Caledonia, weep!\" he had written in his tragedy. Now he wrote\\n\"Mourn, hapless Caledonia, mourn.\" Scott has quoted, from Graham of\\nGartmore, the story of Smollett\\'s writing verses, while Gartmore and\\nothers were playing cards. He read them what he had written, \"The Tears\\nof Scotland,\" and added the last verse on the spot, when warned that his\\nopinions might give offence.\\n \"Yes, spite of thine insulting foe,\\n My sympathising verse shall flow.\"\\nThe \"Tears\" are better than the \"Ode to Blue-Eyed Ann,\" probably Mrs.\\nSmollett. But the courageous author of \"The Tears of Scotland,\" had\\nmanifestly broken with patrons. He also broke with Rich, the manager at\\nCovent Garden, for whom he had written an opera libretto. He had failed\\nas doctor, and as dramatist; nor, as satirist, had he succeeded. Yet he\\nmanaged to wear wig and sword, and to be seen in good men\\'s company.\\nPerhaps his wife\\'s little fortune supported him, till, in 1748, he\\nproduced \"Roderick Random.\" It is certain that we never find Smollett in\\nthe deep distresses of Dr. Johnson and Goldsmith. Novels were now in\\nvogue; \"Pamela\" was recent, \"Joseph Andrews\" was yet more recent,\\n\"Clarissa Harlowe\" had just appeared, and Fielding was publishing \"Tom\\nJones.\" Smollett, too, tried his hand, and, at last, he succeeded.\\nHis ideas of the novel are offered in his preface. The Novel, for him,\\nis a department of Satire; \"the most entertaining and universally\\nimproving.\" To Smollett, \"Roderick Random\" seemed an \"improving\" work!\\n_Ou le didacticisme va t\\'il se nicher_? Romance, he declares, \"arose in\\nignorance, vanity, and superstition,\" and declined into \"the ludicrous\\nand unnatural.\" Then Cervantes \"converted romance to purposes far more\\nuseful and entertaining, by making it assume the sock, and point out the\\nfollies of ordinary life.\" Romance was to revive again some twenty years\\nafter its funeral oration was thus delivered. As for Smollett himself,\\nhe professedly \"follows the plan\" of Le Sage, in \"Gil Blas\" (a plan as\\nold as Petronius Arbiter, and the \"Golden Ass\" of Apuleius); but he gives\\nmore place to \"compassion,\" so as not to interfere with \"generous\\nindignation, which ought to animate the reader against the sordid and\\nvicious disposition of the world.\" As a contrast to sordid vice, we are\\nto admire \"modest merit\" in that exemplary orphan, Mr. Random. This\\ngentleman is a North Briton, because only in North Britain can a poor\\norphan get such an education as Roderick\\'s \"birth and character require,\"\\nand for other reasons. Now, as for Roderick, the schoolmaster \"gave\\nhimself no concern about the progress I made,\" but, \"should endeavour,\\nwith God\\'s help, to prevent my future improvement.\" It must have been at\\nGlasgow University, then, that Roderick learned \"Greek very well, and was\\npretty far advanced in the mathematics,\" and here he must have used his\\ngenius for the _belles lettres_, in the interest of his \"amorous\\ncomplexion,\" by \"lampooning the rivals\" of the young ladies who admired\\nhim.\\nSuch are the happy beginnings, accompanied by practical jokes, of this\\ninteresting model. Smollett\\'s heroes, one conceives, were intended to be\\nfine, though not faultless young fellows; men, not plaster images; brave,\\ngenerous, free-living, but, as Roderick finds once, when examining his\\nconscience, pure from serious stains on that important faculty. To us\\nthese heroes often appear no better than ruffians; Peregrine Pickle, for\\nexample, rather excels the infamy of Ferdinand, Count Fathom, in certain\\nrespects; though Ferdinand is professedly \"often the object of our\\ndetestation and abhorrence,\" and is left in a very bad, but, as \"Humphrey\\nClinker\" shows, in by no means a hopeless way. Yet, throughout, Smollett\\nregarded himself as a moralist, a writer of improving tendencies; one who\\n\"lashed the vices of the age.\" He was by no means wholly mistaken, but\\nwe should probably wrong the eighteenth century if we accepted all\\nSmollett\\'s censures as entirely deserved. The vices which he lashed are\\nthose which he detected, or fancied that he detected, in people who\\nregarded a modest and meritorious Scottish orphan with base indifference.\\nUnluckily the greater part of mankind was guilty of this crime, and\\nconsequently was capable of everything.\\nEnough has probably been said about the utterly distasteful figure of\\nSmollett\\'s hero. In Chapter LX. we find him living on the resources of\\nStrap, then losing all Strap\\'s money at play, and then \"I bilk my\\ntaylor.\" That is, Roderick orders several suits of new clothes, and\\nsells them for what they will fetch. Meanwhile Strap can live honestly\\nanywhere, while he has his ten fingers. Roderick rescues himself from\\npoverty by engaging, with his uncle, in the slave trade. We are apt to\\nconsider this commerce infamous. But, in 1763, the Evangelical director\\nwho helped to make Cowper \"a castaway,\" wrote, as to the slaver\\'s\\nprofession: \"It is, indeed, accounted a genteel employment, and is\\nusually very profitable, though to me it did not prove so, the Lord\\nseeing that a large increase of wealth could not be good for me.\" The\\nreverend gentleman had, doubtless, often sung--\\n \"_Time for us to go_,\\n _Time for us to go_,\\n _And when we\\'d got the hatches down_,\\n \\'_Twas time for us to go_!\"\\nRoderick, apart from \"black ivory,\" is aided by his uncle and his long\\nlost father. The base world, in the persons of Strap, Thompson, the\\nuncle, Mr. Sagely, and other people, treats him infinitely better than he\\ndeserves. His very love (as always in Smollett) is only an animal\\nappetite, vigorously insisted upon by the author. By a natural reaction,\\nScott, much as he admired Smollett, introduced his own blameless heroes,\\nand even Thackeray could only hint at the defects of youth, in \"Esmond.\"\\nThackeray is accused of making his good people stupid, or too simple, or\\neccentric, and otherwise contemptible. Smollett went further: Strap, a\\nmodel of benevolence, is ludicrous and a coward; even Bowling has the\\nstage eccentricities of the sailor. Mankind was certain, in the long\\nrun, to demand heroes more amiable and worthy of respect. Our\\ninclinations, as Scott says, are with \"the open-hearted, good-humoured,\\nand noble-minded Tom Jones, whose libertinism (one particular omitted) is\\nperhaps rendered but too amiable by his good qualities.\" To be sure\\nRoderick does befriend \"a reclaimed street-walker\" in her worst need, but\\nwhy make her the _confidante_ of the virginal Narcissa? Why reward Strap\\nwith her hand? Fielding decidedly, as Scott insists, \"places before us\\nheroes, and especially heroines, of a much higher as well as more\\npleasing character, than Smollett was able to present.\"\\n\"But the deep and fertile genius of Smollett afforded resources\\nsufficient to make up for these deficiencies . . . If Fielding had\\nsuperior taste, the palm of more brilliancy of genius, more inexhaustible\\nrichness of invention, must in justice be awarded to Smollett. In\\ncomparison with his sphere, that in which Fielding walked was limited . . .\"\\nThe second part of Scott\\'s parallel between the men whom he\\nconsidered the greatest of our novelists, qualifies the first. Smollett\\'s\\ninvention was not richer than Fielding\\'s, but the sphere in which he\\nwalked, the circle of his experience, was much wider. One division of\\nlife they knew about equally well, the category of rakes, adventurers,\\ncard-sharpers, unhappy authors, people of the stage, and ladies without\\nreputations, in every degree. There were conditions of higher society,\\nof English rural society, and of clerical society, which Fielding, by\\nbirth and education, knew much better than Smollett. But Smollett had\\nthe advantage of his early years in Scotland, then as little known as\\nJapan; with the \"nautical multitude,\" from captain to loblolly boy, he\\nwas intimately familiar; with the West Indies he was acquainted; and he\\nlater resided in Paris, and travelled in Flanders, so that he had more\\nexperience, certainly, if not more invention, than Fielding.\\nIn \"Roderick Random\" he used Scottish \"local colour\" very little, but his\\nlife had furnished him with a surprising wealth of \"strange experiences.\"\\nInns were, we must believe, the favourite home of adventures, and\\nSmollett could ring endless changes on mistakes about bedrooms. None of\\nthem is so innocently diverting as the affair of Mr. Pickwick and the\\nlady in yellow curl-papers; but the absence of that innocence which\\nheightens Mr. Pickwick\\'s distresses was welcome to admirers of what Lady\\nMary Wortley Montagu calls \"gay reading.\"\\nShe wrote from abroad, in 1752, \"There is something humorous in R.\\nRandom, that makes me believe that the author is H. Fielding\"--her\\nkinsman. Her ladyship did her cousin little justice. She did not\\ncomplain of the morals of \"R. Random,\" but thought \"Pamela\" and\\n\"Clarissa\" \"likely to do more general mischief than the works of Lord\\nRochester.\" Probably \"R. Random\" did little harm. His career is too\\nobviously ideal. Too many ups and downs occur to him, and few orphans of\\nmerit could set before themselves the ideal of bilking their tailors,\\ngambling by way of a profession, dealing in the slave trade, and\\nwheedling heiresses.\\nThe variety of character in the book is vast; in Morgan we have an\\nexcellent, fiery, Welshman, of the stage type; the different minor\\nmiscreants are all vividly designed; the eccentric lady author may have\\nhad a real original; Miss Snapper has much vivacity as a wit; the French\\nadventures in the army are, in their rude barbaric way, a forecast of\\nBarry Lyndon\\'s; and, generally, both Scott and Thackeray owe a good deal\\nto Smollett in the way of suggestions. Smollett\\'s extraordinary love of\\ndilating on noisome smells and noisome sights, that intense affection for\\nthe physically nauseous, which he shared with Swift, is rather less\\nmarked in \"Roderick\" than in \"Humphrey Clinker,\" and \"The Adventures of\\nan Atom.\" The scenes in the Marshalsea must have been familiar to\\nDickens. The terrible history of Miss Williams is Hogarth\\'s Harlot\\'s\\nProgress done into unsparing prose. Smollett guides us at a brisk pace\\nthrough the shady and brutal side of the eighteenth century; his vivacity\\nis as unflagging as that of his disagreeable rattle of a hero. The\\npassion usually understood as love is, to be sure, one of which he seems\\nto have no conception; he regards a woman much as a greedy person might\\nregard a sirloin of beef, or, at least, a plate of ortolans. At her\\nmarriage a bride is \"dished up;\" that is all.\\nThus this \"gay writing\" no longer makes us gay. In reading \"Peregrine\\nPickle\" and \"Humphrey Clinker,\" a man may find himself laughing aloud,\\nbut hardly in reading \"Roderick Random.\" The fun is of the cruel\\nprimitive sort, arising merely from the contemplation of somebody\\'s\\npainful discomfiture. Bowling and Rattlin may be regarded with\\naffectionate respect; but Roderick has only physical courage and vivacity\\nto recommend him. Whether Smollett, in Flaubert\\'s deliberate way,\\npurposely abstained from moralising on the many scenes of physical\\ndistress which he painted; or whether he merely regarded them without\\nemotion, has been debated. It seems more probable that he thought they\\ncarried their own moral. It is the most sympathetic touch in Roderick\\'s\\ncharacter, that he writes thus of his miserable crew of slaves: \"Our ship\\nbeing freed from the disagreeable lading of negroes, _to whom indeed I\\nhad been a miserable slave since our leaving the coast of Guinea_, I\\nbegan to enjoy myself.\" Smollett was a physician, and had the\\npitifulness of his profession; though we see how casually he makes Random\\ntouch on his own unwonted benevolence.\\nPeople had not begun to know the extent of their own brutality in the\\nslave trade, but Smollett probably did know it. If a curious prophetic\\nletter attributed to him, and published more than twenty years after his\\ndeath, be genuine; he had the strongest opinions about this form of\\ncommercial enterprise. But he did not wear his heart on his sleeve,\\nwhere he wore his irritable nervous system. It is probable enough that\\nhe felt for the victims of poverty, neglect, and oppression (despite his\\nremarks on hospitals) as keenly as Dickens. We might regard his\\noffensively ungrateful Roderick as a purely dramatic exhibition of a\\nyoung man, if his other heroes were not as bad, or worse; if their few\\nredeeming qualities were not stuck on in patches; and if he had omitted\\nhis remark about Roderick\\'s \"modest merit.\" On the other hand, the good\\nside of Matthew Bramble seems to be drawn from Smollett\\'s own character,\\nand, if that be the case, he can have had little sympathy with his own\\nhumorous Barry Lyndons. Scott and Thackeray leaned to the favourable\\nview: Smollett, his nervous system apart, was manly and kindly.\\nAs regards plot, \"Roderick Random\" is a mere string of picturesque\\nadventures. It is at the opposite pole from \"Tom Jones\" in the matter of\\nconstruction. There is no reason why it should ever stop except the\\nconvenience of printers and binders. Perhaps we lay too much stress on\\nthe somewhat mechanical art of plot-building. Fielding was then setting\\nthe first and best English example of a craft in which the very greatest\\nauthors have been weak, or of which they were careless. Smollett was\\nalways rather more incapable, or rather more indifferent, in\\nplot-weaving, than greater men.\\nIn our day of royalties, and gossip about the gains of authors, it would\\nbe interesting to know what manner and size of a cheque Smollett received\\nfrom his publisher, the celebrated Mr. Osborne. We do not know, but\\nSmollett published his next novel \"on commission,\" \"printed for the\\nAuthor\"; so probably he was not well satisfied with the pecuniary result\\nof \"Roderick Random.\" Thereby, says Dr. Moore, he \"acquired much more\\nreputation than money.\" So he now published \"The Regicide\" \"by\\nsubscription, that method of publication being then more reputable than\\nit has been thought since\" (1797). Of \"The Regicide,\" and its unlucky\\npreface, enough, or more, has been said. The public sided with the\\nmanagers, not with the meritorious orphan.\\nFor the sake of pleasure, or of new experiences, or of economy, Smollett\\nwent to Paris in 1750, where he met Dr. Moore, later his biographer, the\\npoetical Dr. Akenside, and an affected painter. He introduced the poet\\nand painter into \"Peregrine Pickle\"; and makes slight use of a group of\\nexiled Jacobites, including Mr. Hunter of Burnside. In 1750, there were\\nJacobites enough in the French capital, all wondering very much where\\nPrince Charles might be, and quite unconscious that he was their\\nneighbour in a convent in the Rue St. Dominique. Though Moore does not\\nsay so (he is provokingly economical of detail), we may presume that\\nSmollett went wandering in Flanders, as does Peregrine Pickle. It is\\ncurious that he should introduce a Capucin, a Jew, and a black-eyed\\ndamsel, all in the Ghent diligence, when we know that Prince Charles did\\nlive in Ghent, with the black-eyed Miss Walkenshaw, did go about\\ndisguised as a Capucin, and was tracked by a Jewish spy, while the other\\nspy, Young Glengarry, styled himself \"Pickle.\" But all those events\\noccurred about a year after the novel was published in 1751.\\nBefore that date Smollett had got an M.D. degree from Aberdeen\\nUniversity, and, after returning from France, he practised for a year or\\ntwo at Bath. But he could not expect to be successful among fashionable\\ninvalids, and, in \"Humphrey Clinker,\" he make Matthew Bramble give such\\nan account of the Bath waters as M. Zola might envy. He was still trying\\nto gain ground in his profession, when, in March 1751, Mr. D. Wilson\\npublished the first edition of \"Peregrine Pickle\" \"for the Author,\"\\nunnamed. I have never seen this first edition, which was \"very curious\\nand disgusting.\" Smollett, in his preface to the second edition, talks\\nof \"the art and industry that were used to stifle him in the birth, by\\ncertain booksellers and others.\" He now \"reformed the manners, and\\ncorrected the expressions,\" removed or modified some passages of personal\\nsatire, and held himself exempt from \"the numerous shafts of envy,\\nrancour, and revenge, that have lately, both in private and public, been\\nlevelled at his reputation.\" Who were these base and pitiless dastards?\\nProbably every one who did not write favourably about the book. Perhaps\\nSmollett suspected Fielding, whom he attacks in several parts of his\\nworks, treating him as a kind of Jonathan Wild, a thief-taker, and an\\nassociate with thieves. Why Smollett thus misconducted himself is a\\nproblem, unless he was either \"meanly jealous,\" or had taken offence at\\nsome remarks in Fielding\\'s newspaper. Smollett certainly began the war,\\nin the first edition of \"Peregrine Pickle.\" He made a kind of palinode\\nto the \"trading justice\" later, as other people of his kind have done.\\nA point in \"Peregrine Pickle\" easily assailed was the long episode about\\na Lady of Quality: the beautiful Lady Vane, whose memoirs Smollett\\nintroduced into his tale. Horace Walpole found that she had omitted the\\nonly feature in her career of which she had just reason to be proud: the\\nnumber of her lovers. Nobody doubted that Smollett was paid for casting\\nhis mantle over Lady Vane: moreover, he might expect a success of\\nscandal. The _roman a clef_ is always popular with scandal-mongers, but\\nits authors can hardly hope to escape rebuke.\\nIt was not till 1752 that Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, in Italy, received\\n\"Peregrine,\" with other fashionable romances--\"Pompey the Little,\" \"The\\nParish Girl,\" \"Eleanora\\'s Adventures,\" \"The Life of Mrs. Theresa\\nConstantia Phipps,\" \"The Adventures of Mrs. Loveil,\" and so on. Most of\\nthem contained portraits of real people, and, no doubt, most of them were\\ntherefore successful. But where are they now? Lady Mary thought Lady\\nVane\\'s part of \"Peregrine\" \"more instructive to young women than any\\nsermon that I know.\" She regarded Fielding as with Congreve, the only\\n\"original\" of her age, but Fielding had to write for bread, and that is\\n\"the most contemptible way of getting bread.\" She did not, at this time,\\neven know Smollett\\'s name, but she admired him, and, later, calls him \"my\\ndear Smollett.\" This lady thought that Fielding did not know what sorry\\nfellows his Tom Jones and Captain Booth were. Not near so sorry as\\nPeregine Pickle were they, for this gentleman is a far more atrocious\\nruffian than Roderick Random.\\nNone the less \"Peregrine\" is Smollett\\'s greatest work. Nothing is so\\nrich in variety of character, scene, and adventure. We are carried along\\nby the swift and copious volume of the current, carried into very queer\\nplaces, and into the oddest miscellaneous company, but we cannot escape\\nfrom Smollett\\'s vigorous grasp. Sir Walter thought that \"Roderick\"\\nexcelled its successor in \"ease and simplicity,\" and that Smollett\\'s\\nsailors, in \"Pickle,\" \"border on caricature.\" No doubt they do: the\\neccentricities of Hawser Trunnion, Esq., are exaggerated, and Pipes is\\nless subdued than Rattlin, though always delightful. But Trunnion\\nabsolutely makes one laugh out aloud: whether he is criticising the\\nsister of Mr. Gamaliel Pickle in that gentleman\\'s presence, at a\\npot-house; or riding to the altar with his squadron of sailors, tacking\\nin an unfavourable gale; or being run away into a pack of hounds, and\\nclearing a hollow road over a waggoner, who views him with \"unspeakable\\nterror and amazement.\" Mr. Winkle as an equestrian is not more entirely\\nacceptable to the mind than Trunnion. We may speak of \"caricature,\" but\\nif an author can make us sob with laughter, to criticise him solemnly is\\nungrateful.\\nExcept Fielding occasionally, and Smollett, and Swift, and Sheridan, and\\nthe authors of \"The Rovers,\" one does not remember any writers of the\\neighteenth century who quite upset the gravity of the reader. The scene\\nof the pedant\\'s dinner after the manner of the ancients, does not seem to\\nmyself so comic as the adventures of Trunnion, while the bride is at the\\naltar, and the bridegroom is tacking and veering with his convoy about\\nthe fields. One sees how the dinner is done: with a knowledge of\\nAthenaeus, Juvenal, Petronius, and Horace, many men could have written\\nthis set piece. But Trunnion is quite inimitable: he is a child of\\nhumour and of the highest spirits, like Mr. Weller the elder. Till Scott\\ncreated Mause Headrig, no Caledonian had ever produced anything except\\n\"Tam o\\' Shanter,\" that could be a pendant to Trunnion. His pathos is\\npossibly just a trifle overdone, though that is not my own opinion. Dear\\nTrunnion! he makes me overlook the gambols of his detestable _protege_,\\nthe hero.\\nThat scoundrel is not an impossible caricature of an obstinate, vain,\\ncruel libertine. Peregrine was precisely the man to fall in love with\\nEmilia _pour le bon motif_, and then attempt to ruin her, though she was\\nthe sister of his friend, by devices worthy of Lovelace at his last and\\nlowest stage. Peregrine\\'s overwhelming vanity, swollen by facile\\nconquests, would inevitably have degraded him to this abyss. The\\nintrigue was only the worst of those infamous practical jokes of his, in\\nwhich Smollett takes a cruel and unholy delight. Peregrine, in fact, is\\na hero of _naturalisme_, except that his fits of generosity are mere\\npatches daubed on, and that his reformation is a farce, in which a modern\\n_naturaliste_ would have disdained to indulge. Emilia, in her scene with\\nPeregrine in the _bouge_ to which he has carried her, rises much above\\nSmollett\\'s heroines, and we could like her, if she had never forgiven\\nbehaviour which was beneath pardon.\\nPeregrine\\'s education at Winchester bears out Lord Elcho\\'s description of\\nthat academy in his lately published Memoirs. It was apt to develop\\nPeregrines; and Lord Elcho himself might have furnished Smollett with\\nsuitable adventures. There can be no doubt that Cadwallader Crabtree\\nsuggested Sir Malachi Malagrowther to Scott, and that Hatchway and Pipes,\\ntaking up their abode with Peregrine in the Fleet, gave a hint to Dickens\\nfor Sam Weller and Mr. Pickwick in the same abode. That \"Peregrine\"\\n\"does far excel \\'Joseph Andrews\\' and \\'Amelia\\',\" as Scott declares, few\\nmodern readers will admit. The world could do much better without\\n\"Peregrine\" than without \"Joseph\"; while Amelia herself alone is a study\\ngreatly preferable to the whole works of Smollett: such, at least, is the\\nopinion of a declared worshipper of that peerless lady. Yet \"Peregrine\"\\nis a kind of Odyssey of the eighteenth century: an epic of humour and of\\nadventure.\\nIn February 1753, Smollett \"obliged the town\" with his \"Adventures of\\nFerdinand, Count Fathom,\" a cosmopolitan swindler and adventurer. The\\nbook is Smollett\\'s \"Barry Lyndon,\" yet as his hero does not tell his own\\nstory, but is perpetually held up as a \"dreadful example,\" there is none\\nof Thackeray\\'s irony, none of his subtlety. \"Here is a really bad man, a\\nforeigner too,\" Smollett seems to say, \"do not be misled, oh maidens, by\\nthe wiles of such a Count! Impetuous youth, play not with him at\\nbilliards, basset, or gleek. Fathers, on such a rogue shut your doors:\\ncollectors, handle not his nefarious antiques. Let all avoid the path\\nand shun the example of Ferdinand, Count Fathom!\"\\nSuch is Smollett\\'s sermon, but, after all, Ferdinand is hardly worse than\\nRoderick or Peregrine. The son of a terrible old sutler and\\ncamp-follower, a robber and slayer of wounded men, Ferdinand had to live\\nby his wits, and he was hardly less scrupulous, after all, than Peregrine\\nand Roderick. The daubs of casual generosity were not laid on, and that\\nis all the difference. As Sophia Western was mistaken for Miss Jenny\\nCameron, so Ferdinand was arrested as Prince Charles, who, in fact,\\ncaused much inconvenience to harmless travellers. People were often\\narrested as \"The Pretender\\'s son\" abroad as well as in England.\\nThe life and death of Ferdinand\\'s mother, shot by a wounded hussar in her\\nmoment of victory, make perhaps the most original and interesting part of\\nthis hero\\'s adventures. The rest is much akin to his earlier novels, but\\nthe history of Rinaldo and Monimia has a passage not quite alien to the\\nvein of Mrs. Radcliffe. Some remarks in the first chapter show that\\nSmollett felt the censures on his brutality and \"lowness,\" and he\\npromises to seek \"that goal of perfection where nature is castigated\\nalmost even to still life . . . where decency, divested of all substance,\\nhovers about like a fantastic shadow.\"\\nSmollett never reached that goal, and even the shadow of decency never\\nhaunted him so as to make him afraid with any amazement. Smollett avers\\nthat he \"has had the courage to call in question the talents of a pseudo-\\npatron,\" and so is charged with \"insolence, rancour, and scurrility.\" Of\\nall these things, and of worse, he had been guilty; his offence had never\\nbeen limited to \"calling in question the talents\" of persons who had been\\nunsuccessful in getting his play represented. Remonstrance merely\\nirritated Tobias. His new novel was but a fainter echo of his old\\nnovels, a panorama of scoundrelism, with the melodramatic fortunes of the\\nvirtuous Monimia for a foil. If read to-day, it is read as a sketch of\\nmanners, or want of manners. The scene in which the bumpkin squire rooks\\nthe accomplished Fathom at hazard, in Paris, is prettily conceived, and\\nSmollett\\'s indignation at the British system of pews in church is\\nedifying. But when Monimia appears to her lover as he weeps at her tomb,\\nand proves to be no phantom, but a \"warm and substantial\" Monimia,\\ncapable of being \"dished up,\" like any other Smollettian heroine, the\\nreader is sensibly annoyed. Tobias as _un romantique_ is absolutely too\\nabsurd; \"not here, oh Tobias, are haunts meet for thee.\"\\nSmollett\\'s next novel, \"Sir Launcelot Greaves,\" was not published till\\n1761, after it had appeared in numbers, in _The British Magazine_. This\\nwas a sixpenny serial, published by Newbery. The years between 1753 and\\n1760 had been occupied by Smollett in quarrelling, getting imprisoned for\\nlibel, editing the _Critical Review_, writing his \"History of England,\"\\ntranslating (or adapting old translations of) \"Don Quixote,\" and driving\\na team of literary hacks, whose labours he superintended, and to whom he\\ngave a weekly dinner. These exploits are described by Dr. Carlyle, and\\nby Smollett himself, in \"Humphrey Clinker.\" He did not treat his vassals\\nwith much courtesy or consideration; but then they expected no such\\ntreatment. We have no right to talk of his doings as \"a blood-sucking\\nmethod, literary sweating,\" like a recent biographer of Smollett. Not to\\nspeak of the oddly mixed metaphor, we do not know what Smollett\\'s\\nrelations to his retainers really were. As an editor he had to see his\\ncontributors. The work of others he may have recommended, as \"reader\" to\\npublishers. Others may have made transcripts for him, or translations.\\nThat Smollett \"sweated\" men, or sucked their blood, or both, seems a\\ncrude way of saying that he found them employment. Nobody says that\\nJohnson \"sweated\" the persons who helped him in compiling his Dictionary;\\nor that Mr. Jowett \"sweated\" the friends and pupils who aided him in his\\ntranslation of Plato. Authors have a perfect right to procure literary\\nassistance, especially in learned books, if they pay for it, and\\nacknowledge their debt to their allies. On the second point, Smollett\\nwas probably not in advance of his age.\\n\"Sir Launcelot Greaves\" is, according to Chambers, \"a sorry specimen of\\nthe genius of the author,\" and Mr. Oliphant Smeaton calls it \"decidedly\\nthe least popular\" of his novels, while Scott astonishes us by preferring\\nit to \"Jonathan Wild.\" Certainly it is inferior to \"Roderick Random\" and\\nto \"Peregrine Pickle,\" but it cannot be so utterly unreal as \"The\\nAdventures of an Atom.\" I, for one, venture to prefer \"Sir Launcelot\" to\\n\"Ferdinand, Count Fathom.\" Smollett was really trying an experiment in\\nthe fantastic. Just as Mr. Anstey Guthrie transfers the mediaeval myth\\nof Venus and the Ring, or the Arabian tale of the bottled-up geni (or\\ndjinn) into modern life, so Smollett transferred Don Quixote. His hero,\\na young baronet of wealth, and of a benevolent and generous temper, is\\ncrossed in love. Though not mad, he is eccentric, and commences knight-\\nerrant. Scott, and others, object to his armour, and say that, in his\\nordinary clothes, and with his well-filled purse, he would have been more\\nsuccessful in righting wrongs. Certainly, but then the comic fantasy of\\nthe armed knight arriving at the ale-house, and jangling about the rose-\\nhung lanes among the astonished folk of town and country, would have been\\nlost. Smollett is certainly less unsuccessful in wild fantasy, than in\\nthe ridiculous romantic scenes where the substantial phantom of Monimia\\ndisports itself. The imitation of the knight by the nautical Captain\\nCrowe (an excellent Smollettian mariner) is entertaining, and Sir\\nLauncelot\\'s crusty Sancho is a pleasant variety in squires. The various\\nforms of oppression which the knight resists are of historical interest,\\nas also is the contested election between a rustic Tory and a smooth\\nMinisterialist: \"sincerely attached to the Protestant succession, in\\ndetestation of a popish, an abjured, and an outlawed Pretender.\" The\\nheroine, Aurelia Darrel, is more of a lady, and less of a luxury, than\\nperhaps any other of Smollett\\'s women. But how Smollett makes love! \"Tea\\nwas called. The lovers were seated; he looked and languished; she\\nflushed and faltered; all was doubt and delirium, fondness and flutter.\"\\n\"All was gas and gaiters,\" said the insane lover of Mrs. Nickleby, with\\nequal delicacy and point.\\nScott says that Smollett, when on a visit to Scotland, used to write his\\nchapter of \"copy\" in the half-hour before the post went out. Scott was\\nvery capable of having the same thing happen to himself. \"Sir Launcelot\"\\nis hurriedly, but vigorously written: the fantasy was not understood as\\nSmollett intended it to be, and the book is blotted, as usual, with\\nloathsome medical details. But people in Madame du Deffand\\'s circle used\\nopenly to discuss the same topics, to the confusion of Horace Walpole. As\\nthe hero of this book is a generous gentleman, as the most of it is kind\\nand manly, and the humour provocative of an honest laugh, it is by no\\nmeans to be despised, while the manners, if caricatured, are based on\\nfact.\\nIt is curious to note that in \"Sir Launcelot Greaves,\" we find a\\ncharacter, Ferret, who frankly poses as a _strugforlifeur_. M. Daudet\\'s\\n_strugforlifeur_ had heard of Darwin. Mr. Ferret had read Hobbes,\\nlearned that man was in a state of nature, and inferred that we ought to\\nprey upon each other, as a pike eats trout. Miss Burney, too, at Bath,\\nabout 1780, met a perfectly emancipated young \"New Woman.\" She had read\\nBolingbroke and Hume, believed in nothing, and was ready to be a \"Woman\\nwho Did.\" Our ancestors could be just as advanced as we are.\\nSmollett went on compiling, and supporting himself by his compilations,\\nand those of his vassals. In 1762 he unluckily edited a paper called\\n_The Briton_ in the interests of Lord Bute. _The Briton_ was silenced by\\nWilkes\\'s _North Briton_. Smollett lost his last patron; he fell ill; his\\ndaughter died; he travelled angrily in France and Italy. His \"Travels\"\\nshow the choleric nature of the man, and he was especially blamed for not\\nadmiring the Venus de Medici. Modern taste, enlightened by the works of\\na better period of Greek art, has come round to Smollett\\'s opinions. But,\\nin his own day, he was regarded as a Vandal and a heretic.\\nIn 1764, he visited Scotland, and was warmly welcomed by his kinsman, the\\nlaird of Bonhill. In 1769, he published \"The Adventures of an Atom,\" a\\nstupid, foul, and scurrilous political satire, in which Lord Bute, having\\nbeen his patron, was \"lashed\" in Smollett\\'s usual style. In 1768,\\nSmollett left England for ever. He desired a consulship, but no\\nconsulship was found for him, which is not surprising. He died at Monte\\nNova, near Leghorn, in September (others say October) 1771. He had\\nfinished \"Humphrey Clinker,\" which appeared a day or two before his\\ndeath.\\nThackeray thought \"Humphrey Clinker\" the most laughable book that ever\\nwas written. Certainly nobody is to be envied who does not laugh over\\nthe epistles of Winifred Jenkins. The book is too well known for\\nanalysis. The family of Matthew Bramble, Esq., are on their travels,\\nwith his nephew and niece, young Melford and Lydia Melford, with Miss\\nJenkins, and the squire\\'s tart, greedy, and amorous old maid of a sister,\\nTabitha Bramble. This lady\\'s persistent amours and mean avarice scarcely\\nstrike modern readers as amusing. Smollett gave aspects of his own\\ncharacter in the choleric, kind, benevolent Matthew Bramble, and in the\\npatriotic and paradoxical Lieutenant Lismahago. Bramble, a gouty\\ninvalid, is as full of medical abominations as Smollett himself, as ready\\nto fight, and as generous and open-handed. Probably the author shared\\nLismahago\\'s contempt of trade, his dislike of the Union (1707), his fiery\\nindependence (yet he _does_ marry Tabitha!), and those opinions in which\\nLismahago heralds some of the social notions of Mr. Ruskin.\\nMelford is an honourable kind of \"walking gentleman\"; Lydia, though\\nenamoured, is modest and dignified; Clinker is a worthy son of Bramble,\\nwith abundant good humour, and a pleasing vein of Wesleyan Methodism. But\\nthe grotesque spelling, rural vanity, and _naivete_ of Winifred Jenkins,\\nwith her affection for her kitten, make her the most delightful of this\\nwandering company. After beholding the humours and partaking of the\\nwaters of Bath, they follow Smollett\\'s own Scottish tour, and each\\ncharacter gives his picture of the country which Smollett had left at its\\nlowest ebb of industry and comfort, and found so much more prosperous.\\nThe book is a mine for the historian of manners and customs: the novel-\\nreader finds Count Fathom metamorphosed into Mr. Grieve, an exemplary\\napothecary, \"a sincere convert to virtue,\" and \"unaffectedly pious.\"\\nApparently a wave of good-nature came over Smollett: he forgave\\neverybody, his own relations even, and he reclaimed his villain. A\\npatron might have played with him. He mellowed in Scotland: Matthew\\nthere became less tart, and more tolerant; an actual English Matthew\\nwould have behaved quite otherwise. \"Humphrey Clinker\" is an astonishing\\nbook, as the work of an exiled, poor, and dying man. None of his works\\nleaves so admirable an impression of Smollett\\'s virtues: none has so few\\nof his less amiable qualities.\\nWith the cadet of Bonhill, outworn with living, and with labour, died the\\nburly, brawling, picturesque old English novel of humour and of the road.\\nWe have nothing notable in this manner, before the arrival of Mr.\\nPickwick. An exception will scarcely be made in the interest of Richard\\nCumberland, who, as Scott says, \"has occasionally . . . become\\ndisgusting, when he meant to be humorous.\" Already Walpole had begun the\\nnew \"Gothic romance,\" and the \"Castle of Otranto,\" with Miss Burney\\'s\\nnovels, was to lead up to Mrs. Radcliffe and Scott, to Miss Edgeworth and\\nMiss Austen.\\nCHAPTER X: NATHANIEL HAWTHORNE\\nSainte-Beuve says somewhere that it is impossible to speak of \"The German\\nClassics.\" Perhaps he would not have allowed us to talk of the American\\nclassics. American literature is too nearly contemporary. Time has not\\ntried it. But, if America possesses a classic author (and I am not\\ndenying that she may have several), that author is decidedly Hawthorne.\\nHis renown is unimpeached: his greatness is probably permanent, because\\nhe is at once such an original and personal genius, and such a judicious\\nand determined artist.\\nHawthorne did not set himself to \"compete with life.\" He did not make\\nthe effort--the proverbially tedious effort--to say everything. To his\\nmind, fiction was not a mirror of commonplace persons, and he was not the\\nanalyst of the minutest among their ordinary emotions. Nor did he make a\\nmoral, or social, or political purpose the end and aim of his art. Moral\\nas many of his pieces naturally are, we cannot call them didactic. He\\ndid not expect, nor intend, to better people by them. He drew the Rev.\\nArthur Dimmesdale without hoping that his Awful Example would persuade\\nreaders to \"make a clean breast\" of their iniquities and their secrets.\\nIt was the moral situation that interested him, not the edifying effect\\nof his picture of that situation upon the minds of novel-readers.\\nHe set himself to write Romance, with a definite idea of what Romance-\\nwriting should be; \"to dream strange things, and make them look like\\ntruth.\" Nothing can be more remote from the modern system of reporting\\ncommonplace things, in the hope that they will read like truth. As all\\npainters must do, according to good traditions, he selected a subject,\\nand then placed it in a deliberately arranged light--not in the full\\nglare of the noonday sun, and in the disturbances of wind, and weather,\\nand cloud. Moonshine filling a familiar chamber, and making it\\nunfamiliar, moonshine mixed with the \"faint ruddiness on walls and\\nceiling\" of fire, was the light, or a clear brown twilight was the light\\nby which he chose to work. So he tells us in the preface to \"The Scarlet\\nLetter.\" The room could be filled with the ghosts of old dwellers in it;\\nfaint, yet distinct, all the life that had passed through it came back,\\nand spoke with him, and inspired him. He kept his eyes on these figures,\\ntangled in some rare knot of Fate, and of Desire: these he painted, not\\nattending much to the bustle of existence that surrounded them, not\\npermitting superfluous elements to mingle with them, and to distract him.\\nThe method of Hawthorne can be more easily traced than that of most\\nartists as great as himself. Pope\\'s brilliant passages and disconnected\\ntrains of thought are explained when we remember that \"paper-sparing,\" as\\nhe says, he wrote two, or four, or six couplets on odd, stray bits of\\ncasual writing material. These he had to join together, somehow, and\\nbetween his \"Orient Pearls at Random Strung\" there is occasionally \"too\\nmuch string,\" as Dickens once said on another opportunity. Hawthorne\\'s\\nmethod is revealed in his published note-books. In these he jotted the\\ngerm of an idea, the first notion of a singular, perhaps supernatural\\nmoral situation. Many of these he never used at all, on others he would\\ndream, and dream, till the persons in the situations became characters,\\nand the thing was evolved into a story. Thus he may have invented such a\\nproblem as this: \"The effect of a great, sudden sin on a simple and\\njoyous nature,\" and thence came all the substance of \"The Marble Faun\"\\n(\"Transformation\"). The original and germinal idea would naturally\\ndivide itself into another, as the protozoa reproduce themselves. Another\\nidea was the effect of nearness to the great crime on a pure and spotless\\nnature: hence the character of Hilda. In the preface to \"The Scarlet\\nLetter,\" Hawthorne shows us how he tried, by reflection and dream, to\\nwarm the vague persons of the first mere notion or hint into such life as\\ncharacters in romance inherit. While he was in the Civil Service of his\\ncountry, in the Custom House at Salem, he could not do this; he needed\\nfreedom. He was dismissed by political opponents from office, and\\ninstantly he was himself again, and wrote his most popular and, perhaps,\\nhis best book. The evolution of his work was from the prime notion\\n(which he confessed that he loved best when \"strange\") to the short\\nstory, and thence to the full and rounded novel. All his work was\\nleisurely. All his language was picked, though not with affectation. He\\ndid not strive to make a style out of the use of odd words, or of\\nfamiliar words in odd places. Almost always he looked for \"a kind of\\nspiritual medium, seen through which\" his romances, like the Old Manse in\\nwhich he dwelt, \"had not quite the aspect of belonging to the material\\nworld.\"\\nThe spiritual medium which he liked, he was partly born into, and partly\\nhe created it. The child of a race which came from England, robust and\\nPuritanic, he had in his veins the blood of judges--of those judges who\\nburned witches and persecuted Quakers. His fancy is as much influenced\\nby the old fanciful traditions of Providence, of Witchcraft, of haunting\\nIndian magic, as Scott\\'s is influenced by legends of foray and feud, by\\nballad, and song, and old wives\\' tales, and records of conspiracies, fire-\\nraisings, tragic love-adventures, and border wars. Like Scott, Hawthorne\\nlived in phantasy--in phantasy which returned to the romantic past,\\nwherein his ancestors had been notable men. It is a commonplace, but an\\ninevitable commonplace, to add that he was filled with the idea of\\nHeredity, with the belief that we are all only new combinations of our\\nfathers that were before us. This has been made into a kind of pseudo-\\nscientific doctrine by M. Zola, in the long series of his Rougon-Macquart\\nnovels. Hawthorne treated it with a more delicate and a serener art in\\n\"The House of the Seven Gables.\"\\nIt is curious to mark Hawthorne\\'s attempts to break away from\\nhimself--from the man that heredity, and circumstance, and the divine\\ngift of genius had made him. He naturally \"haunts the mouldering lodges\\nof the past\"; but when he came to England (where such lodges are\\nabundant), he was ill-pleased and cross-grained. He knew that a long\\npast, with mysteries, dark places, malisons, curses, historic wrongs, was\\nthe proper atmosphere of his art. But a kind of conscientious desire to\\nbe something other than himself--something more ordinary and popular--make\\nhim thank Heaven that his chosen atmosphere was rare in his native land.\\nHe grumbled at it, when he was in the midst of it; he grumbled in\\nEngland; and how he grumbled in Rome! He permitted the American Eagle to\\nmake her nest in his bosom, \"with the customary infirmity of temper that\\ncharacterises this unhappy fowl,\" as he says in his essay \"The Custom\\nHouse.\" \"The general truculency of her attitude\" seems to \"threaten\\nmischief to the inoffensive community\" of Europe, and especially of\\nEngland and Italy.\\nPerhaps Hawthorne travelled too late, when his habits were too much\\nfixed. It does not become Englishmen to be angry because a voyager is\\nannoyed at not finding everything familiar and customary in lands which\\nhe only visits because they are strange. This is an inconsistency to\\nwhich English travellers are particularly prone. But it is, in\\nHawthorne\\'s case, perhaps, another instance of his conscientious attempts\\nto be, what he was not, very much like other people. His unexpected\\nexplosions of Puritanism, perhaps, are caused by the sense of being too\\nmuch himself. He speaks of \"the Squeamish love of the Beautiful\" as if\\nthe love of the Beautiful were something unworthy of an able-bodied\\ncitizen. In some arts, as in painting and sculpture, his taste was very\\nfar from being at home, as his Italian journals especially prove. In\\nshort, he was an artist in a community for long most inartistic. He\\ncould not do what many of us find very difficult--he could not take\\nBeauty with gladness as it comes, neither shrinking from it as immoral,\\nnor getting girlishly drunk upon it, in the aesthetic fashion, and\\nscreaming over it in an intoxication of surprise. His tendency was to be\\nrather shy and afraid of Beauty, as a pleasant but not immaculately\\nrespectable acquaintance. Or, perhaps, he was merely deferring to Anglo-\\nSaxon public opinion.\\nPossibly he was trying to wean himself from himself, and from his own\\ngenius, when he consorted with odd amateur socialists in farm-work, and\\nwhen he mixed, at Concord, with the \"queer, strangely-dressed,\\noddly-behaved mortals, most of whom took upon themselves to be important\\nagents of the world\\'s destiny, yet were simple bores of a very intense\\nwater.\" They haunted Mr. Emerson as they haunted Shelley, and Hawthorne\\nhad to see much of them. But they neither made a convert of him, nor\\nirritated him into resentment. His long-enduring kindness to the\\nunfortunate Miss Delia Bacon, an early believer in the nonsense about\\nBacon and Shakespeare, was a model of manly and generous conduct. He\\nwas, indeed, an admirable character, and his goodness had the bloom on it\\nof a courteous and kindly nature that loved the Muses. But, as one has\\nventured to hint, the development of his genius and taste was hampered\\nnow and then, apparently, by a desire to put himself on the level of the\\ngeneral public, and of their ideas. This, at least, is how one explains\\nto oneself various remarks in his prefaces, journals, and note-books.\\nThis may account for the moral allegories which too weirdly haunt some of\\nhis short, early pieces. Edgar Poe, in a passage full of very honest and\\nwell-chosen praise, found fault with the allegorical business.\\nMr. Hutton, from whose \"Literary Essays\" I borrow Poe\\'s opinion, says:\\n\"Poe boldly asserted that the conspicuously ideal scaffoldings of\\nHawthorne\\'s stories were but the monstrous fruits of the bad\\ntranscendental atmosphere which he breathed so long.\" But I hope this\\nway of putting it is not Poe\\'s. \"Ideal scaffoldings,\" are odd enough,\\nbut when scaffoldings turn out to be \"fruits\" of an \"atmosphere,\" and\\nmonstrous fruits of a \"bad transcendental atmosphere,\" the brain reels in\\nthe fumes of mixed metaphors. \"Let him mend his pen,\" cried Poe, \"get a\\nbottle of visible ink, come out from the Old Manse, cut Mr. Alcott,\" and,\\nin fact, write about things less impalpable, as Mr. Mallock\\'s heroine\\npreferred to be loved, \"in a more human sort of way.\"\\nHawthorne\\'s way was never too ruddily and robustly human. Perhaps, even\\nin \"The Scarlet Letter,\" we feel too distinctly that certain characters\\nare moral conceptions, not warmed and wakened out of the allegorical into\\nthe real. The persons in an allegory may be real enough, as Bunyan has\\nproved by examples. But that culpable clergyman, Mr. Arthur Dimmesdale,\\nwith his large, white brow, his melancholy eyes, his hand on his heart,\\nand his general resemblance to the High Church Curate in Thackeray\\'s \"Our\\nStreet,\" is he real? To me he seems very unworthy to be Hester\\'s lover,\\nfor she is a beautiful woman of flesh and blood. Mr. Dimmesdale was not\\nonly immoral; he was unsportsmanlike. He had no more pluck than a church-\\nmouse. His miserable passion was degraded by its brevity; how could he\\nsee this woman\\'s disgrace for seven long years, and never pluck up heart\\neither to share her shame or _peccare forliter_? He is a lay figure,\\nvery cleverly, but somewhat conventionally made and painted. The\\nvengeful husband of Hester, Roger Chillingworth, is a Mr. Casaubon stung\\ninto jealous anger. But his attitude, watching ever by Dimmesdale,\\ntormenting him, and yet in his confidence, and ever unsuspected, reminds\\none of a conception dear to Dickens. He uses it in \"David Copperfield,\"\\nwhere Mr. Micawber (of all people!) plays this trick on Uriah Heep; he\\nuses it in \"Hunted Down\"; he was about using it in \"Edwin Drood\"; he used\\nit (old Martin and Pecksniff) in \"Martin Chuzzlewit.\" The person of\\nRoger Chillingworth and his conduct are a little too melodramatic for\\nHawthorne\\'s genius.\\nIn Dickens\\'s manner, too, is Hawthorne\\'s long sarcastic address to Judge\\nPyncheon (in \"The House of the Seven Gables\"), as the judge sits dead in\\nhis chair, with his watch ticking in his hand. Occasionally a chance\\nremark reminds one of Dickens; this for example: He is talking of large,\\nblack old books of divinity, and of their successors, tiny books,\\nElzevirs perhaps. \"These little old volumes impressed me as if they had\\nbeen intended for very large ones, but had been unfortunately blighted at\\nan early stage of their growth.\" This might almost deceive the elect as\\na piece of the true Boz. Their widely different talents did really\\nintersect each other where the perverse, the grotesque, and the terrible\\ndwell.\\nTo myself \"The House of the Seven Gables\" has always appeared the most\\nbeautiful and attractive of Hawthorne\\'s novels. He actually gives us a\\nlove story, and condescends to a pretty heroine. The curse of \"Maule\\'s\\nBlood\" is a good old romantic idea, terribly handled. There is more of\\nlightness, and of a cobwebby dusty humour in Hepzibah Pyncheon, the\\ndecayed lady shopkeeper, than Hawthorne commonly cares to display. Do\\nyou care for the \"first lover,\" the Photographer\\'s Young Man? It may be\\nconventional prejudice, but I seem to see him going about on a tricycle,\\nand I don\\'t think him the right person for Phoebe. Perhaps it is really\\nthe beautiful, gentle, oppressed Clifford who haunts one\\'s memory most, a\\nkind of tragic and thwarted Harold Skimpole. \"How pleasant, how\\ndelightful,\" he murmured, but not as if addressing any one. \"Will it\\nlast? How balmy the atmosphere through that open window! An open\\nwindow! How beautiful that play of sunshine. Those flowers, how very\\nfragrant! That young girl\\'s face, how cheerful, how blooming. A flower\\nwith the dew on it, and sunbeams in the dewdrops . . . \" This comparison\\nwith Skimpole may sound like an unkind criticism of Clifford\\'s character\\nand place in the story--it is only a chance note of a chance resemblance.\\nIndeed, it may be that Hawthorne himself was aware of the resemblance.\\n\"An individual of Clifford\\'s character,\" he remarks, \"can always be\\npricked more acutely through his sense of the beautiful and harmonious\\nthan through his heart.\" And he suggests that, if Clifford had not been\\nso long in prison, his aesthetic zeal \"might have eaten out or filed away\\nhis affections.\" This was what befell Harold Skimpole--himself \"in\\nprisons often\"--at Coavinses! The Judge Pyncheon of the tale is also a\\nmasterly study of swaggering black-hearted respectability, and then, in\\naddition to all the poetry of his style, and the charm of his haunted\\nair, Hawthorne favours us with a brave conclusion of the good sort, the\\nold sort. They come into money, they marry, they are happy ever after.\\nThis is doing things handsomely, though some of our modern novelists\\nthink it coarse and degrading. Hawthorne did not think so, and they are\\nnot exactly better artists than Hawthorne.\\nYet he, too, had his economies, which we resent. I do not mean his not\\ntelling us what it was that Roger Chillingworth saw on Arthur\\nDimmesdale\\'s bare breast. To leave that vague is quite legitimate. But\\nwhat had Miriam and the spectre of the Catacombs done? Who was the\\nspectre? What did he want? To have told all this would have been better\\nthan to fill the novel with padding about Rome, sculpture, and the Ethics\\nof Art. As the silly saying runs: \"the people has a right to know\" about\\nMiriam and her ghostly acquaintance. {10} But the \"Marble Faun\" is not\\nof Hawthorne\\'s best period, beautiful as are a hundred passages in the\\ntale.\\nBeautiful passages are as common in his prose as gold in the richest\\nquartz. How excellent are his words on the first faint but certain\\nbreath of Autumn in the air, felt, perhaps, early in July. \"And then\\ncame Autumn, with his immense burthen of apples, dropping them\\ncontinually from his overladen shoulders as he trudged along.\" Keats\\nmight have written so of Autumn in the orchards--if Keats had been\\nwriting prose.\\nThere are geniuses more sunny, large, and glad than Hawthorne\\'s, none\\nmore original, more surefooted, in his own realm of moonlight and\\ntwilight.\\nCHAPTER XI: THE PARADISE OF POETS\\nWe were talking of Love, Constancy, the Ideal. \"Who ever loved like the\\npoets?\" cried Lady Violet Lebas, her pure, pale cheek flushing. \"Ah, if\\never I am to love, he shall be a singer!\"\\n\"Tenors are popular, very,\" said Lord Walter.\\n\"I mean a poet,\" she answered witheringly.\\nNear them stood Mr. Witham, the author of \"Heart\\'s Chords Tangled.\"\\n\"Ah,\" said he, \"that reminds me. I have been trying to catch it all the\\nmorning. That reminds me of my dream.\"\\n\"Tell us your dream,\" murmured Lady Violet Lebas, and he told it.\\n\"It was through an unfortunate but pardonable blunder,\" said Mr. Witham,\\n\"that I died, and reached the Paradise of Poets. I had, indeed,\\npublished volumes of verse, but with the most blameless motives. Other\\npoets were continually sending me theirs, and, as I could not admire\\nthem, and did not like to reply by critical remarks, I simply printed\\nsome rhymes for the purpose of sending them to the gentlemen who favoured\\nme with theirs. I always wrote on the fly-leaf a quotation from the\\n\\'Iliad,\\' about giving copper in exchange for gold; and the few poets who\\ncould read Greek were gratified, while the others, probably, thought a\\ncompliment was intended. Nothing could be less culpable or pretentious,\\nbut, through some mistake on the part of Charon, I was drafted off to the\\nParadise of Poets.\\n\"Outside the Golden Gate a number of Shadows were waiting, in different\\nattitudes of depression and languor. Bavius and Maevius were there,\\nstill complaining of \\'cliques,\\' railing at Horace for a mere rhymer of\\nsociety, and at Virgil as a plagiarist, \\'Take away his cribs from Homer\\nand Apollonius Rhodius,\\' quoth honest Maevius, \\'and what is there left of\\nhim?\\' I also met a society of gentlemen, in Greek costume, of various\\nages, from a half-naked minstrel with a tortoiseshell lyre in his hand to\\nan elegant of the age of Pericles. They all consorted together, talking\\nvarious dialects of Aeolic, Ionian, Attic Greek, and so forth, which were\\nplainly not intelligible to each other. I ventured to ask one of the\\ncompany who he was, but he, with a sweep of his hand, said, \\'We are\\nHomer!\\' When I expressed my regret and surprise that the Golden Gate had\\nnot yet opened for so distinguished, though collective, an artist, my\\nfriend answered that, according to Fick, Peppmuller, and many other\\nlearned men, they were Homer. \\'But an impostor from Chios has got in\\nsomehow,\\' he said; \\'they don\\'t pay the least attention to the Germans in\\nthe Paradise of Poets.\\'\\n\"At this moment the Golden Gates were thrown apart, and a fair lady, in\\nan early Italian costume, carrying a laurel in her hand, appeared at the\\nentrance. All the Shadows looked up with an air of weary expectation,\\nlike people waiting for their turn in a doctor\\'s consulting-room. She\\nbeckoned to me, however, and I made haste to follow her. The words\\n\\'Charlatan!\\' \\'You a poet!\\' in a variety of languages, greeted me by way\\nof farewell from the Shadows.\\n\"\\'The renowned Laura, if I am not mistaken,\\' I ventured to remark,\\nrecognising her, indeed, from the miniature in the Laurentian library at\\nFlorence.\\n\"She bowed, and I began to ask for her adorer, Petrarch.\\n\"\\'Excuse me,\\' said Laura, as we glided down a mossy path, under the shade\\nof trees particularly dear to poets, \\'excuse me, but the sonneteer of\\nwhom you speak is one whose name I cannot bear to mention. His conduct\\nwith Burns\\'s Clarinda, his heartless infatuation for Stella--\\'\\n\"\\'You astonish me,\\' I said. \\'In the Paradise of Poets--\\'\\n\"\\'They are poets still--incorrigible!\\' answered the lady; then slightly\\nraising her voice of silver, as a beautiful appearance in a toga drew\\nnear, she cried \\'_Catullo mio_!\\'\\n\"The greeting between these accomplished ghosts was too kindly to leave\\nroom for doubt as to the ardour of their affections.\\n\"\\'Will you, my Catullus,\\' murmured Laura, \\'explain to this poet from the\\nland of fogs, any matters which, to him, may seem puzzling and unfamiliar\\nin our Paradise?\\'\\n\"The Veronese, with a charming smile, took my hand, and led me to a\\nshadowy arbour, whence we enjoyed a prospect of many rivers and mountains\\nin the poets\\' heaven. Among these I recognised the triple crest of the\\nEildons, Grongar Hill, Cithaeron and Etna; while the reed-fringed waters\\nof the Mincius flowed musically between the banks and braes o\\' bonny Doon\\nto join the Tweed. Blithe ghosts were wandering by, in all varieties of\\napparel, and I distinctly observed Dante\\'s Beatrice, leaning loving on\\nthe arm of Sir Philip Sidney, while Dante was closely engaged in\\nconversation with the lost Lenore, celebrated by Mr. Edgar Allan Poe.\\n\"\\'In what can my knowledge of the Paradise of Poets be serviceable to\\nyou, sir?\\' said Catullus, as he flung himself at the feet of Laura, on\\nthe velvet grass.\\n\"\\'I am disinclined to seem impertinently curious,\\' I answered, \\'but the\\nladies in this fair, smiling country--have the gods made them poetical?\\'\\n\"\\'Not generally,\\' replied Catullus. \\'Indeed, if you would be well with\\nthem, I may warn you never to mention poetry in their hearing. They\\nnever cared for it while on earth, and in this place it is a topic which\\nthe prudent carefully avoid among ladies. To tell the truth, they have\\nhad to listen to far too much poetry, and too many discussions on the\\ncaesura. There are, indeed, a few lady poets--very few. Sappho, for\\nexample; indeed I cannot recall any other at this moment. The result is\\nthat Phaon, of all the shadows here, is the most distinguished by the\\nfair. He was not a poet, you know; he got in on account of Sappho, who\\nadored him. They are estranged now, of course.\\'\\n\"\\'You interest me deeply,\\' I answered. \\'And now, will you kindly tell me\\nwhy these ladies are here, if they were not poets?\\'\\n\"\\'The women that were our ideals while we dwelt on earth, the women we\\nloved but never won, or, at all events, never wedded, they for whom we\\nsighed while in the arms of a recognised and legitimate affection, have\\nbeen chosen by the Olympians to keep us company in Paradise!\\'\\n\"\\'Then wherefore,\\' I interrupted, \\'do I see Robert Burns loitering with\\nthat lady in a ruff,--Cassandra, I make no doubt--Ronsard\\'s Cassandra?\\nAnd why is the incomparable Clarinda inseparable from Petrarch; and Miss\\nPatty Blount, Pope\\'s flame, from the Syrian Meleager, while _his_\\nHeliodore is manifestly devoted to Mr. Emerson, whom, by the way, I am\\ndelighted, if rather surprised, to see here?\\'\\n\"\\'Ah,\\' said Catullus, \\'you are a new-comer among us. Poets will be\\npoets, and no sooner have they attained their desire, and dwelt in the\\ncompany of their earthly Ideals, than they feel strangely, yet\\nirresistibly drawn to Another. So it was in life, so it will ever be. No\\nIdeal can survive a daily companionship, and fortunate is the poet who\\ndid not marry his first love!\\'\\n\"\\'As far as that goes,\\' I answered, \\'most of you were highly favoured;\\nindeed, I do not remember any poet whose Ideal was his wife, or whose\\nfirst love led him to the altar.\\'\\n\"\\'I was not a marrying man myself,\\' answered the Veronese; \\'few of us\\nwere. Myself, Horace, Virgil--we were all bachelors.\\'\\n\"\\'And Lesbia!\\'\\n\"I said this in a low voice, for Laura was weaving bay into a chaplet,\\nand inattentive to our conversation.\\n\"\\'Poor Lesbia!\\' said Catullus, with a suppressed sigh. \\'How I misjudged\\nthat girl! How cruel, how causeless were my reproaches,\\' and wildly\\nrending his curled locks and laurel crown, he fled into a thicket, whence\\nthere soon arose the melancholy notes of the Ausonian lyre.\\'\\n\"\\'He is incorrigible,\\' said Laura, very coldly; and she deliberately\\nbegan to tear and toss away the fragments of the chaplet she had been\\nweaving. \\'I shall never break him of that habit of versifying. But they\\nare all alike.\\'\\n\"\\'Is there nobody here,\\' said I, \\'who is happy with his Ideal--nobody but\\nhas exchanged Ideals with some other poet?\\'\\n\"\\'There is one,\\' she said. \\'He comes of a northern tribe; and in his\\nlife-time he never rhymed upon his unattainable lady, or if rhyme he did,\\nthe accents never carried her name to the ears of the vulgar. Look\\nthere.\\'\\n\"She pointed to the river at our feet, and I knew the mounted figure that\\nwas riding the ford, with a green-mantled lady beside him like the Fairy\\nQueen.\\n\"Surely I had read of her, and knew her--\\n \"\\'She whose blue eyes their secret told,\\n Though shaded by her locks of gold.\\'\\n\"\\'They are different; I know not why. They are constant,\\' said Laura,\\nand rising with an air of chagrin, she disappeared among the boughs of\\nthe trees that bear her name.\\n\"\\'Unhappy hearts of poets,\\' I mused. \\'Light things and sacred they are,\\nbut even in their Paradise, and among their chosen, with every wish\\nfulfilled, and united to their beloved, they cannot be at rest!\\'\\n\"Thus moralising, I wended my way to a crag, whence there was a wide\\nprospect. Certain poets were standing there, looking down into an abyss,\\nand to them I joined myself.\\n\"\\'Ah, I cannot bear it!\\' said a voice, and, as he turned away, his brow\\nalready clearing, his pain already forgotten, I beheld the august form of\\nShakespeare.\\n\"Marking my curiosity before it was expressed, he answered the unuttered\\nquestion.\\n\"\\'That is a sight for Pagans,\\' he said, \\'and may give them pleasure. But\\nmy Paradise were embittered if I had to watch the sorrows of others, and\\ntheir torments, however well deserved. The others are gazing on the\\npurgatory of critics and commentators.\\'\\n\"He passed from me, and I joined the \\'Ionian father of the rest\\'--Homer,\\nwho, with a countenance of unspeakable majesty, was seated on a throne of\\nrock, between the Mantuan Virgil of the laurel crown, Hugo, Sophocles,\\nMilton, Lovelace, Tennyson, and Shelley.\\n\"At their feet I beheld, in a vast and gloomy hall, many an honest\\ncritic, many an erudite commentator, an army of reviewers. Some were\\ncondemned to roll logs up insuperable heights, whence they descended\\nthundering to the plain. Others were set to impositions, and I\\nparticularly observed that the Homeric commentators were obliged to write\\nout the \\'Iliad\\' and \\'Odyssey\\' in their complete shape, and were always\\ndriven by fiends to the task when they prayed for the bare charity of\\nbeing permitted to leave out the \\'interpolations.\\' Others, fearful to\\nnarrate, were torn into as many fragments as they had made of these\\nimmortal epics. Others, such as Aristarchus, were spitted on their own\\ncritical signs of disapproval. Many reviewers were compelled to read the\\nbooks which they had criticised without perusal, and it was terrible to\\nwatch the agonies of the worthy pressmen who were set to this unwonted\\ntask. \\'May we not be let off with the preface?\\' they cried in piteous\\naccents. \\'May we not glance at the table of contents and be done with\\nit?\\' But the presiding demons (who had been Examiners in the bodily\\nlife) drove them remorseless to their toils.\\n\"Among the condemned I could not but witness, with sympathy, the\\npunishment reserved for translators. The translators of Virgil, in\\nparticular, were a vast and motley assemblage of most respectable men.\\nBishops were there, from Gawain Douglas downwards; Judges, in their\\nermine; professors, clergymen, civil servants, writhing in all the\\ntortures that the blank verse, the anapaestic measure, the metre of the\\n\\'Lay of the Last Minstrel,\\' the heroic couplet and similar devices can\\ninflict. For all these men had loved Virgil, though not wisely: and now\\ntheir penance was to hear each other read their own translations.\"\\n\"That must have been more than they could bear,\" said Lady Violet\\n\"Yes,\" said Mr. Witham; \"I should know, for down I fell into Tartarus\\nwith a crash, and writhed among the Translators.\"\\n\"Why?\" asked Lady Violet.\\n\"Because I have translated Theocritus!\"\\n\"Mr. Witham,\" said Lady Violet, \"did you meet your ideal woman when you\\nwere in the Paradise of Poets?\"\\n\"She yet walks this earth,\" said the bard, with a too significant bow.\\nLady Violet turned coldly away.\\n* * *\\nMr. Witham was never invited to the Blues again--the name of Lord Azure\\'s\\nplace in Kent.\\nThe Poet is shut out of Paradise.\\nCHAPTER XII: PARIS AND HELEN\\nThe first name in romance, the most ancient and the most enduring, is\\nthat of Argive Helen. During three thousand years fair women have been\\nborn, have lived, and been loved, \"that there might be a song in the ears\\nof men of later time,\" but, compared to the renown of Helen, their glory\\nis dim. Cleopatra, who held the world\\'s fate in her hands, and lay in\\nthe arms of Caesar; Mary Stuart (_Maria Verticordia_), for whose sake, as\\na northern novelist tells, peasants have lain awake, sorrowing that she\\nis dead; Agnes Sorel, Fair Rosamond, la belle Stuart, \"the Pompadour and\\nthe Parabere,\" can still enchant us from the page of history and\\nchronicle. \"Zeus gave them beauty, which naturally rules even strength\\nitself,\" to quote the Greek orator on the mistress of them all, on her\\nwho, having never lived, can never die, the Daughter of the Swan.\\nWhile Helen enjoys this immortality, and is the ideal of beauty upon\\nearth, it is curious to reflect on the _modernite_ of her story, the\\noldest of the love stories of the world. In Homer we first meet her, the\\nfairest of women in the song of the greatest of poets. It might almost\\nseem as if Homer meant to justify, by his dealing with Helen, some of the\\nmost recent theories of literary art. In the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey\" the\\ntale of Helen is without a beginning and without an end, like a frieze on\\na Greek temple. She crosses the stage as a figure familiar to all, the\\npoet\\'s audience clearly did not need to be told who Helen was, nor\\nanything about her youth.\\nThe famous judgment of Paris, the beginning of evil to Achaeans and Ilian\\nmen, is only mentioned once by Homer, late, and in a passage of doubtful\\nauthenticity. Of her reconciliation to her wedded lord, Menelaus, not a\\nword is said; of her end we are told no more than that for her and him a\\nmansion in Elysium is prepared--\\n \"Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow.\"\\nWe leave her happy in Argos, a smile on her lips, a gift in her hands, as\\nwe met her in Troy, beautiful, adored despite her guilt, as sweet in her\\nrepentance as in her unvexed Argive home. Women seldom mention her, in\\nthe epic, but with horror and anger; men never address her but in gentle\\ncourtesy. What is her secret? How did she leave her home with\\nParis--beguiled by love, by magic, or driven by the implacable Aphrodite?\\nHomer is silent on all of these things; these things, doubtless, were\\nknown by his audience. In his poem Helen moves as a thing of simple\\ngrace, courtesy, and kindness, save when she rebels against her doom,\\nafter seeing her lover fly from her husband\\'s spear. Had we only Homer,\\nby far our earliest literary source, we should know little of the romance\\nof Helen; should only know that a lawless love brought ruin on Troy and\\nsorrow on the Achaeans; and this is thrown out, with no moral comment,\\nwithout praise or blame. The end, we learn, was peace, and beauty was\\nreconciled to life. There is no explanation, no _denouement_; and we\\nknow how much _denouement_ and explanations hampered Scott and\\nShakespeare. From these trammels Homer is free, as a god is free from\\nmortal limitations.\\nAll this manner of telling a tale--a manner so ancient, so original--is\\nakin, in practice, to recent theories of what art should be, and what art\\nseldom is, perhaps never is, in modern hands.\\nModern enough, again, is the choice of a married woman for the heroine of\\nthe earliest love tale. Apollonius Rhodius sings (and no man has ever\\nsung so well) of a maiden\\'s love; Virgil, of a widow\\'s; Homer, of love\\nthat has defied law, blindly obedient to destiny, which dominates even\\nZeus. Once again, Helen is not a very young girl; ungallant\\nchronologists have attributed to her I know not what age. We think of\\nher as about the age of the Venus of Milo; in truth, she was \"ageless and\\nimmortal.\" Homer never describes her beauty; we only see it reflected in\\nthe eyes of the old men, white and weak, thin-voiced as cicalas: but hers\\nis a loveliness \"to turn an old man young.\" \"It is no marvel,\" they say,\\n\"that for her sake Trojans and Achaeans slay each other.\"\\nShe was embroidering at a vast web, working in gold and scarlet the\\nsorrows that for her sake befell mankind, when they called her to the\\nwalls to see Paris fight Menelaus, in the last year of the war. There\\nshe stands, in raiment of silvery white, her heart yearning for her old\\nlove and her own city. Already her thought is far from Paris. Was her\\nheart ever with Paris? That is her secret. A very old legend, mentioned\\nby the Bishop of Thessalonica, Eustathius, tells us that Paris magically\\nbeguiled her, disguised in the form of Menelaus, her lord, as Uther\\nbeguiled Ygerne. She sees the son of Priam play the dastard in the\\nfight; she turns in wrath on Aphrodite, who would lure her back to his\\narms; but to his arms she must go, \"for the daughter of Zeus was afraid.\"\\nViolence is put upon beauty; it is soiled, or seems soiled, in its way\\nthrough the world. Helen urges Paris again into the war. He has a heart\\ninvincibly light and gay; shame does not weigh on him. \"Not every man is\\nvaliant every day,\" he says; yet once engaged in battle, he bears him\\nbravely, and his arrows rain death among the mail-clad Achaeans.\\nWhat Homer thinks of Paris we can only guess. His beauty is the bane of\\nIlios; but Homer forgives so much to beauty. In the end of the \"Iliad,\"\\nHelen sings the immortal dirge over Hector, the stainless knight, \"with\\nthy loving kindness and thy gentle speech.\"\\nIn the \"Odyssey,\" she is at home again, playing the gracious part of\\nhostess to Odysseus\\'s wandering son, pouring into the bowl the magic herb\\nof Egypt, \"which brings forgetfulness of sorrow.\" The wandering son of\\nOdysseus departs with a gift for his bride, \"to wear upon the day of her\\ndesire, a memorial of the hands of Helen,\" the beautiful hands, that in\\nTroy or Argos were never idle.\\nOf Helen, from Homer, we know no more. Grace, penitence in exile, peace\\nat home, these are the portion of her who set East and West at war and\\nruined the city of Priam of the ashen spear. As in the strange legend\\npreserved by Servius, the commentator on Virgil, who tells us that Helen\\nwore a red \"star-stone,\" whence fell gouts of blood that vanished ere\\nthey touched her swan\\'s neck; so all the blood shed for her sake leaves\\nHelen stainless. Of Homer\\'s Helen we know no more.\\nThe later Greek fancy, playing about this form of beauty, wove a myriad\\nof new fancies, or disinterred from legend old beliefs untouched by\\nHomer. Helen was the daughter of the Swan--that is, as was later\\nexplained, of Zeus in the shape of a swan. Her loveliness, even in\\nchildhood, plunged her in many adventures. Theseus carried her off; her\\nbrothers rescued her. All the princes of Achaea competed for her hand,\\nhaving first taken an oath to avenge whomsoever she might choose for her\\nhusband. The choice fell on the correct and honourable, but rather\\ninconspicuous, Menelaus, and they dwelt in Sparta, beside the Eurotas,\\n\"in a hollow of the rifted hills.\" Then, from across the sea, came the\\nbeautiful and fatal Paris, son of Priam, King of Troy. As a child, Paris\\nhad been exposed on the mountains, because his mother dreamed that she\\nbrought forth a firebrand. He was rescued and fostered by a shepherd; he\\ntended the flocks; he loved the daughter of a river god, OEnone. Then\\ncame the naked Goddesses, to seek at the hand of the most beautiful of\\nmortals the prize of beauty. Aphrodite won the golden apple from the\\nqueen of heaven, Hera, and from the Goddess of war and wisdom, Athena,\\nbribing the judge by the promise of the fairest wife in the world. No\\nincident is more frequently celebrated in poetry and art, to which it\\nlends such gracious opportunities. Paris was later recognised as of the\\nroyal blood of Troy. He came to Lacedaemon on an embassy, he saw Helen,\\nand destiny had its way.\\nConcerning the details in this most ancient love-story, we learn nothing\\nfrom Homer, who merely makes Paris remind Helen of their bridal night in\\nthe isle of Cranae. But from Homer we learn that Paris carried off not\\nonly the wife of Menelaus, but many of his treasures. To the poet of the\\n\"Iliad,\" the psychology of the wooing would have seemed a simple matter.\\nLike the later vase-painters, he would have shown us Paris beside Helen,\\nAphrodite standing near, accompanied by the figure of Peitho--Persuasion.\\nHomer always escapes our psychological problems by throwing the weight of\\nour deeds and misdeeds on a God or a Goddess, or on destiny. To have\\nfled from her lord and her one child, Hermione, was not in keeping with\\nthe character of Helen as Homer draws it. Her repentance is almost\\nChristian in its expression, and repentance indicates a consciousness of\\nsin and of shame, which Helen frequently professes. Thus she, at least,\\ndoes not, like Homer, in his chivalrous way, throw all the blame on the\\nImmortals and on destiny. The cheerful acquiescence of Helen in destiny\\nmakes part of the comic element in _La Belle Helene_, but the mirth only\\narises out of the incongruity between Parisian ideas and those of ancient\\nGreece.\\nHelen is freely and bitterly blamed in the \"Odyssey\" by Penelope, chiefly\\nbecause of the ruinous consequences which followed her flight. Still,\\nthere is one passage, when Penelope prudently hesitates about recognising\\nher returned lord, which makes it just possible that a legend chronicled\\nby Eustathius was known to Homer,--namely, the tale already mentioned,\\nthat Paris beguiled her in the shape of Menelaus. The incident is very\\nold, as in the story of Zeus and Amphitryon, and might be used whenever a\\nlady\\'s character needed to be saved. But this anecdote, on the whole, is\\ninconsistent with the repentance of Helen, and is not in Homer\\'s manner.\\nThe early lyric poet, Stesichorus, is said to have written harshly\\nagainst Helen. She punished him by blindness, and he indited a palinode,\\nexplaining that it was not she who went to Troy, but a woman fashioned in\\nher likeness, by Zeus, out of mist and light. The real Helen remained\\nsafely and with honour in Egypt. Euripides has made this idea, which was\\ncalculated to please him, the groundwork of his \"Helena,\" but it never\\nhad a strong hold on the Greek imagination. Modern fancy is pleased by\\nthe picture of the cloud-bride in Troy, Greeks and Trojans dying for a\\nphantasm. \"Shadows we are, and shadows we pursue.\"\\nConcerning the later feats, and the death of Paris, Homer says very\\nlittle. He slew Achilles by an arrow-shot in the Scaean gate, and\\nprophecy was fulfilled. He himself fell by another shaft, perhaps the\\npoisoned shaft of Philoctetes. In the fourth or fifth century of our era\\na late poet, Quintus Smyrnaeus, described Paris\\'s journey, in quest of a\\nhealing spell, to the forsaken OEnone, and her refusal to aid him; her\\ndeath on his funeral pyre. Quintus is a poet of extraordinary merit for\\nhis age, and scarcely deserves the reproach of laziness affixed on him by\\nLord Tennyson.\\nOn the whole, Homer seems to have a kind of half-contemptuous liking for\\nthe beautiful Paris. Later art represents him as a bowman of girlish\\ncharms, wearing a Phrygian cap. There is a late legend that he had a\\nson, Corythus, by OEnone, and that he killed the lad in a moment of\\njealousy, finding him with Helen and failing to recognise him. On the\\ndeath of Paris, perhaps by virtue of the custom of the Levirate, Helen\\nbecame the wife of his brother, Deiphobus.\\nHow her reconciliation with Menelaus was brought about we do not learn\\nfrom Homer, who, in the \"Odyssey,\" accepts it as a fact. The earliest\\ntraditional hint on the subject is given by the famous \"Coffer of\\nCypselus,\" a work of the seventh century, B.C., which Pausanias saw at\\nOlympia, in A.D. 174. Here, on a band of ivory, was represented, among\\nother scenes from the tale of Troy, Menelaus rushing, sword in hand, to\\nslay Helen. According to Stesichorus, the army was about to stone her\\nafter the fall of Ilios, but relented, amazed by her beauty.\\nOf her later life in Lacedaemon, nothing is known on really ancient\\nauthority, and later traditions vary. The Spartans showed her sepulchre\\nand her shrine at Therapnae, where she was worshipped. Herodotus tells\\nus how Helen, as a Goddess, appeared in her temple and healed a deformed\\nchild, making her the fairest woman in Sparta, in the reign of Ariston.\\nIt may, perhaps, be conjectured that in Sparta, Helen occupied the place\\nof a local Aphrodite. In another late story she dwells in the isle of\\nLeuke, a shadowy bride of the shadowy Achilles. The mocking Lucian, in\\nhis _Vera Historia_, meets Helen in the Fortunate Islands, whence she\\nelopes with one of his companions. Again, the sons of Menelaus, by a\\nconcubine, were said to have driven Helen from Sparta on the death of her\\nlord, and she was murdered in Rhodes, by the vengeance of Polyxo, whose\\nhusband fell at Troy. But, among all these inventions, that of Homer\\nstands out pre-eminent. Helen and Menelaus do not die, they are too near\\nakin to Zeus; they dwell immortal, not among the shadows of heroes and of\\nfamous ladies dead and gone, but in Elysium, the paradise at the world\\'s\\nend, unvisited by storms.\\n \"Beyond these voices there is peace.\"\\nIt is plain that, as a love-story, the tale of Paris and Helen must to\\nmodern readers seem meagre. To Greece, in every age, the main interest\\nlay not in the passion of the beautiful pair, but in its world-wide\\nconsequences: the clash of Europe and Asia, the deaths of kings, the ruin\\nwrought in their homes, the consequent fall of the great and ancient\\nAchaean civilisation. To the Greeks, the Trojan war was what the\\nCrusades are in later history. As in the Crusades, the West assailed the\\nEast for an ideal, not to recover the Holy Sepulchre of our religion, but\\nto win back the living type of beauty and of charm. Perhaps, ere the sun\\ngrows cold, men will no more believe in the Crusades, as an historical\\nfact, than we do in the siege of Troy. In a sense, a very obvious sense,\\nthe myth of Helen is a parable of Hellenic history. They sought beauty,\\nand they found it; they bore it home, and, with beauty, their bane.\\nWherever Helen went \"she brought calamity,\" in this a type of all the\\nfamous and peerless ladies of old days, of Cleopatra and of Mary Stuart.\\nRomance and poetry have nothing less plausible than the part which\\nCleopatra actually played in the history of the world, a world well lost\\nby Mark Antony for her sake. The flight from Actium might seem as much a\\nmere poet\\'s dream as the gathering of the Achaeans at Aulis, if we were\\nnot certain that it is truly chronicled.\\nFrom the earliest times, even from times before Homer (whose audience is\\nsupposed to know all about Helen), the imagination of Greece, and later,\\nthe imagination of the civilised world, has played around Helen, devising\\nabout her all that possibly could be devised. She was the daughter of\\nZeus by Nemesis, or by Leda; or the daughter of the swan, or a child of\\nthe changeful moon, brooding on \"the formless and multi-form waters.\" She\\ncould speak in the voices of all women, hence she was named \"Echo,\" and\\nwe might fancy that, like the witch of the Brocken, she could appear to\\nevery man in the likeness of his own first love. The ancient Egyptians\\neither knew her, or invented legends of her to amuse the inquiring\\nGreeks. She had touched at Sidon, and perhaps Astaroth is only her\\nSidonian name. Whatever could be told of beauty, in its charm, its\\nperils, the dangers with which it surrounds its lovers, the purity which\\nit retains, unsmirched by all the sins that are done for beauty\\'s sake,\\ncould be told of Helen.\\nLike a golden cup, as M. Paul de St. Victor says, she was carried from\\nlips to lips of heroes, but the gold remains unsullied and unalloyed. To\\nheaven she returns again, to heaven which is her own, and looks down\\nserenely on men slain, and women widowed, and sinking ships, and burning\\ntowns. Yet with death she gives immortality by her kiss, and Paris and\\nMenelaus live, because they have touched the lips of Helen. Through the\\ngrace of Helen, for whom he fell, Sarpedon\\'s memory endures, and Achilles\\nand Memnon, the son of the Morning, and Troy is more imperishable than\\nCarthage, or Rome, or Corinth, though Helen\\n \"Burnt the topless towers of Ilium.\"\\nIn one brief passage, Marlowe did more than all poets since Stesichorus,\\nor, at least since the epithalamium of Theocritus, for the glory of\\nHelen. Roman poets knew her best as an enemy of their fabulous\\nancestors, and in the \"AEneid,\" Virgil\\'s hero draws his sword to slay\\nher. Through the Middle Ages, in the romances of Troy, she wanders as a\\nshining shadow of the ideally fair, like Guinevere, who so often recalls\\nher in the Arthurian romances. The chivalrous mediaeval poets and the\\nCelts could understand better than the Romans the philosophy of \"the\\nworld well lost\" for love. Modern poetry, even in Goethe\\'s \"Second part\\nof Faust,\" has not been very fortunately inspired by Helen, except in the\\nfew lines which she speaks in \"The Dream of Fair Women.\"\\n \"I had great beauty; ask thou not my name.\"\\nMr. William Morris\\'s Helen, in the \"Earthly Paradise,\" charms at the time\\nof reading, but, perhaps, leaves little abiding memory. The Helen of\\n\"Troilus and Cressida\" is not one of Shakespeare\\'s immortal women, and\\nMr. Rossetti\\'s ballad is fantastic and somewhat false in tone--a romantic\\n_pastiche_. Where Euripides twice failed, in the \"Troades\" and the\\n\"Helena,\" it can be given to few to succeed. Helen is best left to her\\nearliest known minstrel, for who can recapture the grace, the tenderness,\\nthe melancholy, and the charm of the daughter of Zeus in the \"Odyssey\"\\nand \"Iliad\"? The sightless eyes of Homer saw her clearest, and Helen was\\nbest understood by the wisdom of his unquestioning simplicity.\\nAs if to prove how entirely, though so many hands paltered with her\\nlegend, Helen is Homer\\'s alone, there remains no great or typical work of\\nGreek art which represents her beauty, and the breasts from which were\\nmodelled cups of gold for the service of the gods. We have only\\npaintings on vases, or work on gems, which, though graceful, is\\nconventional and might represent any other heroine, Polyxena, or\\nEriphyle. No Helen from the hands of Phidias or Scopas has survived to\\nour time, and the grass may be growing in Therapnae over the shattered\\nremains of her only statue.\\nAs Stesichorus fabled that only an _eidolon_ of Helen went to Troy, so,\\nexcept in the \"Iliad\" and \"Odyssey,\" we meet but shadows of her\\nloveliness, phantasms woven out of clouds, and the light of setting suns.\\nCHAPTER XIII: ENCHANTED CIGARETTES\\nTo dream over literary projects, Balzac says, is like \"smoking enchanted\\ncigarettes,\" but when we try to tackle our projects, to make them real,\\nthe enchantment disappears. We have to till the soil, to sow the seed,\\nto gather the leaves, and then the cigarettes must be manufactured, while\\nthere may be no market for them after all. Probably most people have\\nenjoyed the fragrance of these enchanted cigarettes, and have brooded\\nover much which they will never put on paper. Here are some of \"the\\nashes of the weeds of my delight\"--memories of romances whereof no single\\nline is written, or is likely to be written.\\nOf my earliest novel I remember but little. I know there had been a\\nwreck, and that the villain, who was believed to be drowned, came home\\nand made himself disagreeable. I know that the heroine\\'s mouth was _not_\\n\"too large for regular beauty.\" In that respect she was original. All\\nheroines are \"muckle-mou\\'d,\" I know not why. It is expected of them. I\\nknow she was melancholy and merry; it would not surprise me to learn that\\nshe drowned herself from a canoe. But the villain never descended to\\ncrime, the first lover would not fall in love, the heroine\\'s own\\naffections were provokingly disengaged, and the whole affair came to a\\ndead stop for want of a plot. Perhaps, considering modern canons of\\nfiction, this might have been a very successful novel. It was entirely\\ndevoid of incident or interest, and, consequently, was a good deal like\\nreal life, as real life appears to many cultivated authors. On the other\\nhand, all the characters were flippant. This would never have done, and\\nI do not regret novel No. I., which had not even a name.\\nThe second story had a plot, quantities of plot, nothing but plot. It\\nwas to have been written in collaboration with a very great novelist,\\nwho, as far as we went, confined himself to making objections. This\\nnovel was stopped (not that my friend would ever have gone on) by \"Called\\nBack,\" which anticipated part of the idea. The story was entitled \"Where\\nis Rose?\" and the motto was--\\n \"_Rosa quo locorum_\\n _Sera moratur_.\"\\nThe characters were--(1) Rose, a young lady of quality. (2) The Russian\\nPrincess, her friend (need I add that, to meet a public demand, _her_\\nname was Vera?). (3) Young man engaged to Rose. (4) Charles, his\\nfriend. (5) An enterprising person named \"The Whiteley of Crime,\" the\\nuniversal Provider of Iniquity. In fact, he anticipated Sir Arthur\\nDoyle\\'s Professor Moriarty. The rest were detectives, old ladies, mob,\\nand a wealthy young Colonial larrikin. Neither my friend nor I was fond\\nof describing love scenes, so we made the heroine disappear in the second\\nchapter, and she never turned up again till chapter the last. After\\nplaying in a comedy at the house of an earl, Rosa and Vera entered her\\nbrougham. Soon afterwards the brougham drew up, _empty_, at Rose\\'s own\\ndoor. Where _was_ Rose? Traces of her were found, of all places, in the\\nHaunted House in Berkeley Square, which is not haunted any longer. After\\nthat Rose was long sought in vain.\\nThis, briefly, is what had occurred. A Russian detective \"wanted\" Vera,\\nwho, to be sure, was a Nihilist. To catch Vera he made an alliance with\\n\"The Whiteley of Crime.\" He was a man who would destroy a parish\\nregister, or forge a will, or crack a crib, or break up a Pro-Boer\\nmeeting, or burn a house, or kidnap a rightful heir, or manage a\\npersonation, or issue amateur bank-notes, or what you please. Thinking\\nto kill two birds with one stone, he carried off Rose for her diamonds\\nand Vera for his friend, the Muscovite police official, lodging them both\\nin the Haunted House. But there he and the Russian came to blows, and,\\nin the confusion, Vera made her escape, while Rose was conveyed, _as\\nVera_, to Siberia. Not knowing how to dispose of her, the Russian police\\nconsigned her to a nunnery at the mouth of the Obi. Her lover, in a\\nyacht, found her hiding-place, and got a friendly nun to give her some\\nnarcotic known to the Samoyeds. It was the old _truc_ of the Friar in\\n\"Romeo and Juliet.\" At the mouth of the Obi they do not bury the dead,\\nbut lay them down on platforms in the open air. Rose was picked up there\\nby her lover (accompanied by a chaperon, of course), was got on board the\\nsteam yacht, and all went well. I forget what happened to \"The Whiteley\\nof Crime.\" After him I still rather hanker--he was a humorous ruffian.\\nSomething could be made of \"The Whiteley of Crime.\" Something _has_ been\\nmade, by the author of \"Sherlock Holmes.\"\\nIn yet another romance, a gentleman takes his friend, in a country place,\\nto see his betrothed. The friend, who had only come into the\\nneighbourhood that day, is found dead, next morning, hanging to a tree.\\nGipsies and others are suspected. But the lover was the murderer. He\\nhad been a priest, in South America, and the lady was a Catholic (who\\nknew not of his Orders). Now the friend fell in love with the lady at\\nfirst sight, on being introduced to her by the lover. As the two men\\nwalked home, the friend threatened to reveal the lover\\'s secret--his\\ntonsure--which would be fatal to his hopes. They quarrelled, parted, and\\nthe ex-priest lassoed his friend. The motive, I think, is an original\\none, and not likely to occur to the first comer. The inventor is open to\\noffers.\\nThe next novel, based on a dream, was called \"In Search of Qrart.\"\\nWhat is _Qrart_? I decline to divulge this secret beyond saying that\\n_Qrart_ was a product of the civilisation which now sleeps under the\\nsnows of the pole. It was an article of the utmost value to humanity.\\nFarther I do not intend to commit myself. The Bride of a God was one of\\nthe characters.\\nThe next novel is, at present, my favourite cigarette. The scene is\\npartly in Greece, partly at the Parthian Court, about 80-60 B.C. Crassus\\nis the villain. The heroine was an actress in one of the wandering Greek\\ncompanies, splendid strollers, who played at the Indian and Asiatic\\nCourts. The story ends with the representation of the \"Bacchae,\" in\\nParthia. The head of Pentheus is carried by one of the Bacchae in that\\ndrama. Behold, it is not a mask, but _the head of Crassus_, and thus\\nconveys the first news of the Roman defeat. Obviously, this is a novel\\nthat needs a great deal of preliminary study, as much, indeed, as\\n\"Salammbo.\"\\nAnother story will deal with the Icelandic discoverers of America. Mr.\\nKipling, however, has taken the wind out of its sails with his sketch,\\n\"The Finest Story in the World.\" There are all the marvels and portents\\nof the _Eyrbyggja Saga_ to draw upon, there are Skraelings to fight, and\\nwhy should not Karlsefni\\'s son kill the last mastodon, and, as\\nQuetzalcoatl, be the white-bearded god of the Aztecs? After that a\\nromance on the intrigues to make Charles Edward King of Poland sounds\\ncommonplace. But much might be made of that, too, if the right man took\\nit in hand. Believe me, there are plenty of stories left, waiting for\\nthe man who can tell them. I have said it before, but I say it again, if\\nI were king I would keep court officials, Mr. Stanley Weyman, Mr. Mason,\\nMr. Kipling, and others, to tell me my own stories. I know the kind of\\nthing which I like, from the discovery of _Qrart_ to that of the French\\ngold in the burn at Loch Arkaig, or in \"the wood by the lochside\" that\\nMurray of Broughton mentions.\\nAnother cigarette I have, the adventures of a Poet, a Poet born in a\\nPuritan village of Massachusetts about 1670. Hawthorne could have told\\nme my story, and how my friend was driven into the wilderness and lived\\namong the Red Men. I think he was killed in an attempt to warn his\\ncountrymen of an Indian raid; I think his MS. poems have a bullet-hole\\nthrough them, and blood on the leaves. They were in Carew\\'s best manner,\\nthese poems.\\nAnother tale Hawthorne might have told me, the tale of an excellent man,\\nwhose very virtues, by some baneful moral chemistry, corrupt and ruin the\\npeople with whom he comes in contact. I do not mean by goading them into\\nthe opposite extremes, but rather something like a moral _jettatura_.\\nThis needs a great deal of subtlety, and what is to become of the hero?\\nIs he to plunge into vice till everybody is virtuous again? It wants\\nworking out. I have omitted, after all, a schoolboy historical romance,\\nexplaining _why Queen Elizabeth was never married_. A Scottish paper\\noffered a prize for a story of Queen Mary Stuart\\'s reign. I did not get\\nthe prize--perhaps did not deserve it, but my story ran thus: You must\\nknow that Queen Elizabeth was singularly like Darnley in personal\\nappearance. What so natural as that, disguised as a page, her Majesty\\nshould come spying about the Court of Holyrood? Darnley sees her walking\\nout of Queen Mary\\'s room, he thinks her an hallucination, discovers that\\nshe is real, challenges her, and they fight at Faldonside, by the Tweed,\\nShakespeare holding Elizabeth\\'s horse. Elizabeth is wounded, and is\\ncarried to the Kirk of Field, and laid in Darnley\\'s chamber, while\\nDarnley goes out and makes love to my rural heroine, the lady of\\nFernilee, a Kerr. That night Bothwell blows up the Kirk of Field,\\nElizabeth and all. Darnley has only one resource. Borrowing the riding\\nhabit of the rural heroine, the lady of Fernilee, he flees across the\\nBorder, and, for the rest of his life, personates Queen Elizabeth. That\\nis why Elizabeth, who was Darnley, hated Mary so bitterly (on account of\\nthe Kirk of Field affair), and _that is why Queen Elizabeth was never\\nmarried_. Side-lights on Shakespeare\\'s Sonnets were obviously cast. The\\nyoung man whom Shakespeare admired so, and urged to marry, was--Darnley.\\nThis romance did not get the prize (the anachronism about Shakespeare is\\nworthy of Scott), but I am conceited enough to think it deserved an\\nhonourable mention.\\nEnough of my own cigarettes. But there are others of a more fragrant\\nweed. Who will end for me the novel of which Byron only wrote a chapter;\\nwho, as Bulwer Lytton is dead? A finer opening, one more mysteriously\\nstirring, you can nowhere read. And the novel in letters, which Scott\\nbegan in 1819, who shall finish it, or tell us what he did with his fair\\nVenetian courtezan, a character so much out of Sir Walter\\'s way? He\\ntossed it aside--it was but an enchanted cigarette--and gave us \"The\\nFortunes of Nigel\" in its place. I want both. We cannot call up those\\nwho \"left half told\" these stories. In a happier world we shall listen\\nto their endings, and all our dreams shall be coherent and concluded.\\nMeanwhile, without trouble, and expense, and disappointment, and reviews,\\nwe can all smoke our cigarettes of fairyland. Would that many people\\nwere content to smoke them peacefully, and did not rush on pen, paper,\\nand ink!\\nCHAPTER XIV: STORIES AND STORY-TELLING\\n(From STRATH NAVER)\\nWe have had a drought for three weeks. During a whole week this northern\\nstrath has been as sunny as the Riviera is expected to be. The streams\\ncan be crossed dry-shod, kelts are plunging in the pools, but even kelts\\nwill not look at a fly. Now, by way of a pleasant change, an icy north\\nwind is blowing, with gusts of snow, not snow enough to swell the loch\\nthat feeds the river, but just enough snow (as the tourist said of the\\nwater in the River Styx) \"to swear by,\" or at! _The Field_ announces\\nthat a duke, who rents three rods on a neighbouring river, has not yet\\ncaught one salmon. The acrimoniously democratic mind may take comfort in\\nthat intelligence, but, if the weather will not improve for a duke, it is\\nnot likely to change for a mere person of letters. Thus the devotee of\\nthe Muses is driven back, by stress of climate, upon literature, and as\\nthere is nothing in the lodge to read he is compelled to write.\\nNow certainly one would not lack material, if only one were capable of\\nthe art of fiction. The genesis of novels and stories is a topic little\\nstudied, but I am inclined to believe that, like the pearls in the\\nmussels of the river, fiction is a beautiful disease of the brain.\\nSomething, an incident or an experience, or a reflection, gets imbedded,\\nincrusted, in the properly constituted mind, and becomes the nucleus of a\\npearl of romance. Mr. Marion Crawford, in a recent work, describes his\\nhero, who is a novelist, at work. This young gentleman, by a series of\\nfaults or misfortunes, has himself become a centre of harrowing emotion.\\nTwo young ladies, to each of whom he has been betrothed, are weeping out\\ntheir eyes for him, or are kneeling to heaven with despairing cries, or\\nare hardening their hearts to marry men for whom they \"do not care a\\nbawbee.\" The hero\\'s aunt has committed a crime; everybody, in fact, is\\nin despair, when an idea occurs to the hero. Indifferent to the sorrows\\nof his nearest and dearest, he sits down with his notion and writes a\\nnovel--writes like a person possessed.\\nHe has the proper kind of brain, the nucleus has been dropped into it,\\nthe pearl begins to grow, and to assume prismatic hues. So he is happy,\\nand even the frozen-out angler might be happy if he could write a novel\\nin the absence of salmon. Unluckily, my brain is not capable of this\\naesthetic malady, and to save my life, or to \"milk a fine warm cow rain,\"\\nas the Zulus say, I could not write a novel, or even a short story. About\\nThe Short Story, as they call it, with capital letters, our critical\\nAmerican cousins have much to say. Its germ, one fancies, is usually an\\nincident, or a mere anecdote, according to the nature of the author\\'s\\nbrain; this germ becomes either the pearl of a brief _conte_, or the seed\\nof a stately tree, in three volumes. An author of experience soon finds\\nout how he should treat his material. One writer informs me that, given\\nthe idea, the germinal idea, it is as easy for him to make a novel out of\\nit as a tale--as easy, and much more satisfactory and remunerative.\\nOthers, like M. Guy de Maupassant, for example, seem to find their\\nstrength in brevity, in cutting down, not in amplifying; in selecting and\\nreducing, not in allowing other ideas to group themselves round the\\nfirst, other characters to assemble about those who are essential. That\\nseems to be really the whole philosophy of this matter, concerning which\\nso many words are expended. The growth of the germinal idea depends on\\nthe nature of an author\\'s talent--he may excel in expansion, or in\\nreduction; he may be economical, and out of an anecdote may spin the\\nwhole cocoon of a romance; or he may be extravagant, and give a capable\\nidea away in the briefest form possible.\\nThese ideas may come to a man in many ways, as we said, from a dream,\\nfrom a fragmentary experience (as most experiences in life are\\nfragmentary), from a hint in a newspaper, from a tale told in\\nconversation. Not long ago, for example, I heard an anecdote out of\\nwhich M. Guy de Maupassant could have made the most ghastly, the most\\nsqualid, and the most supernaturally moving of all his _contes_. Indeed,\\nthat is not saying much, as he did not excel in the supernatural. Were\\nit written in French, it might lie in my lady\\'s chamber, and, as times\\ngo, nobody would be shocked. But, by our curious British conventions,\\nthis tale cannot be told in an English book or magazine. It was not, in\\nits tendency, immoral; those terrible tales never are. The events were\\nrather calculated to frighten the hearer into the paths of virtue. When\\nMr. Richard Cameron, the founder of the Cameronians, and the godfather of\\nthe Cameronian Regiment, was sent to his parish, he was bidden by Mr.\\nPeden to \"put hell-fire to the tails\" of his congregation. This vigorous\\nexpression was well fitted to describe the _conte_ which I have in my\\nmind (I rather wish I had it not), and which is not to be narrated here,\\nnor in English.\\nFor a combination of pity and terror, it seemed to me unmatched in the\\nworks of the modern fancy, or in the horrors of modern experience;\\nwhether in experience or in imagination it had its original source. But\\neven the English authors, who plume themselves on their audacity, or\\ntheir realism, or their contempt for \"the young person,\" would not\\nventure this little romance, much less, then, is a timidly uncorrect pen-\\nman likely to tempt Mr. Mudie with the _conte_. It is one of two tales,\\nboth told as true, which one would like to be able to narrate in the\\nlanguage of Moliere. The other is also very good, and has a wonderful\\nscene with a corpse and a _chapelle ardente_, and a young lady; it is\\nhistorical, and of the last generation but one.\\nEven our frozen strath here has its modern legend, which may be told in\\nEnglish, and out of which, I am sure, a novelist could make a good short\\nstory, or a pleasant opening chapter of a romance. What is the\\nmysterious art by which these things are done? What makes the well-told\\nstory seem real, rich with life, actual, engrossing? It is the secret of\\ngenius, of the novelist\\'s art, and the writer who cannot practise the art\\nmight as well try to discover the Philosopher\\'s Stone, or to \"harp fish\\nout of the water.\" However, let me tell the legend as simply as may be,\\nand as it was told to me.\\nThe strath runs due north, the river flowing from a great loch to the\\nNorthern sea. All around are low, undulating hills, brown with heather,\\nand as lonely almost as the Sahara. On the horizon to the south rise the\\nmountains, Ben this and Ben that, real mountains of beautiful outline,\\nthough no higher than some three thousand feet. Before the country was\\ndivided into moors and forests, tenanted by makers of patent corkscrews,\\nand boilers of patent soap, before the rivers were distributed into\\nbeats, marked off by white and red posts, there lived over to the south,\\nunder the mountains, a sportsman of athletic frame and adventurous\\ndisposition. His name I have forgotten, but we may call him Dick\\nLindsay. It is told of him that he once found a poacher in the forest,\\nand, being unable to catch the intruder, fired his rifle, not at him, but\\nin his neighbourhood, whereon the poacher, deliberately kneeling down,\\ntook a long shot at Dick. How the duel ended, and whether either party\\nflew a flag of truce, history does not record.\\nAt all events, one stormy day in late September, Dick had stalked and\\nwounded a stag on the hills to the south-east of the strath. Here, if\\nonly one were a novelist, one could weave several pages of valuable copy\\nout of the stalk. The stag made for the strath here, and Dick, who had\\nno gillie, but was an independent sportsman of the old school, pursued on\\nfoot. Plunging down the low, birch-clad hills, the stag found the\\nflooded river before him, black and swollen with rain. He took the\\nwater, crossing by the big pool, which looked almost like a little loch,\\ntempestuous under a north wind blowing up stream, and covered with small\\nwhite, vicious crests. The stag crossed and staggered up the bank, where\\nhe stood panting. It is not a humane thing to leave a deer to die slowly\\nof a rifle bullet, and Dick, reaching the pool, hesitated not, but threw\\noff his clothes, took his skene between his teeth, plunged in, and swam\\nthe river.\\nAll naked as he was he cut the stag\\'s throat in the usual manner, and\\ngralloched him with all the skill of Bucklaw. This was very well, and\\nvery well it would be to add a description of the stag at bay; but as I\\nnever happened to see a stag at bay, I omit all that. Dick had achieved\\nsuccess, but his clothes were on one side of a roaring river in spate,\\nand he and the dead stag were on the other. There was no chance of\\nfording the stream, and there was then no bridge. He did not care to\\nswim back, for the excitement was out of him. He was trembling with\\ncold, and afraid of cramp. \"A mother-naked man,\" in a wilderness, with a\\nflood between him and his raiment, was in a pitiable position. It did\\nnot occur to him to flay the stag, and dress in the hide, and, indeed, he\\nwould have been frozen before he could have accomplished that task. So\\nhe reconnoitred.\\nThere was nobody within sight but one girl, who was herding cows. Now\\nfor a naked man, with a knife, and bedabbled with blood, to address a\\nyoung woman on a lonely moor is a delicate business. The chances were\\nthat the girl would flee like a startled fawn, and leave Dick to walk,\\njust as he was, to the nearest farmhouse, about a mile away. However,\\nDick had to risk it; he lay down so that only his face appeared above the\\nbank, and he shouted to the maiden. When he had caught her attention he\\nbriefly explained the unusual situation. Then the young woman behaved\\nlike a trump, or like a Highland Nausicaa, for students of the \"Odyssey\"\\nwill remember how Odysseus, simply clad in a leafy bough of a tree, made\\nsupplication to the sea-king\\'s daughter, and how she befriended him. Even\\nif Dick had been a reader of Homer, which is not probable, there were no\\ntrees within convenient reach, and he could not adopt the leafy covering\\nof Odysseus.\\n\"You sit still; if you move an inch before I give you the word, I\\'ll\\nleave you where you are!\" said Miss Mary. She then cast her plaid over\\nher face, marched up to the bank where Dick was crouching and shivering,\\ndropped her ample plaid over him, and sped away towards the farmhouse.\\nWhen she had reached its shelter, and was giving an account of the\\nadventure, Dick set forth, like a primeval Highlander, the covering doing\\nduty both for plaid and kilt. Clothes of some kind were provided for him\\nat the cottage, a rickety old boat was fetched, and he and his stag were\\nrowed across the river to the place where his clothes lay.\\nThat is all, but if one were a dealer in romance, much play might be made\\nwith the future fortunes of the sportsman and the maiden, happy fortunes\\nor unhappy. In real life, the lassie \"drew up with\" a shepherd lad, as\\nMiss Jenny Denison has it, married him, and helped to populate the\\nstrath. As for Dick, history tells no more of his adventures, nor is it\\nalleged that he ever again visited the distant valley, or beheld the face\\nof his Highland Nausicaa.\\nNow, if one were a romancer, this mere anecdote probably would \"rest,\\nlovely pearl, in the brain, and slowly mature in the oyster,\" till it\\nbecame a novel. Properly handled, the incident would make a very\\nagreeable first chapter, with the aid of scenery, botany, climate, and\\nremarks on the manners and customs of the red deer stolen from St. John,\\nor the Stuarts d\\'Albanie. Then, probably, one would reflect on the\\ncharacters of Mary and of Richard; Mary must have parents, of course, and\\none would make them talk in Scottish. Probably she already had a lover;\\nhow should she behave to that lover? There is plenty of room for\\nspeculation in that problem. As to Dick, is he to be a Lothario, or a\\nlover _pour le bon motif_? What are his distinguished family to think of\\nthe love affair, which would certainly ensue in fiction, though in real\\nlife nobody thought of it at all? Are we to end happily, with a marriage\\nor marriages, or are we to wind all up in the pleasant, pessimistic,\\nrealistic, fashionable modern way? Is Mary to drown the baby in the\\nMuckle Pool? Is she to suffer the penalty of her crime at Inverness? Or,\\nhappy thought, shall we not make her discarded rival lover meet Dick in\\nthe hills on a sunny day and then--are they not (taking a hint from\\nfacts) to fight a duel with rifles? I see Dick lying, with a bullet in\\nhis brow, on the side of a corrie; his blood crimsons the snow, an eagle\\nstoops from the sky. That makes a pretty picturesque conclusion to the\\nunwritten romance of the strath.\\nAnother anecdote occurs to me; good, I think, for a short story, but\\ncapable, also, of being dumped down in the middle of a long novel. It\\nwas in the old coaching days. A Border squire was going north, in the\\ncoach, alone. At a village he was joined by a man and a young lady:\\ntheir purpose was manifest, they were a runaway couple, bound for Gretna\\nGreen. They had not travelled long together before the young lady,\\nturning to the squire, said, \"_Vous parlez francais, Monsieur_?\" He did\\nspeak French--it was plain that the bridegroom did not--and, to the end\\nof the journey, that remarkable lady conducted a lively and affectionate\\nconversation with the squire in French! Manifestly, he had only to ask\\nand receive, but, alas! he was an unadventurous, plain gentleman; he\\nalighted at his own village; he drove home in his own dogcart; the\\nfugitive pair went forward, and the Gretna blacksmith united them in holy\\nmatrimony. The rest is silence.\\nI would give much to know what that young person\\'s previous history and\\nadventures had been, to learn what befell her after her wedding, to\\nunderstand, in brief, her conduct and her motives. Were I a novelist, a\\nMaupassant, or a Meredith, the Muse, \"from whatsoever quarter she chose,\"\\nwould enlighten me about all, and I would enlighten you. But I can only\\nmarvel, only throw out the hint, only deposit the grain of sand, the\\nnucleus of romance, in some more fertile brain. Indeed the topic is much\\nmore puzzling than the right conclusion for my Highland romance. In that\\ncase fancy could find certain obvious channels, into one or other of\\nwhich it must flow. But I see no channels for the lives of these three\\nqueerly met people in the coach.\\nAs a rule, fancies are capable of being arranged in but a few familiar\\npatterns, so that it seems hardly worth while to make the arrangement.\\nBut he who looks at things thus will never be a writer of stories. Nay,\\neven of the slowly unfolding tale of his own existence he may weary, for\\nthe combinations therein have all occurred before; it is in a hackneyed\\nold story that he is living, and you, and I. Yet to act on this\\nknowledge is to make a bad affair of our little life: we must try our\\nbest to take it seriously. And so of story-writing. As Mr. Stevenson\\nsays, a man must view \"his very trifling enterprise with a gravity that\\nwould befit the cares of empire, and think the smallest improvement worth\\naccomplishing at any expense of time and industry. The book, the statue,\\nthe sonata, must be gone upon with the unreasoning good faith and the\\nunflagging spirit of children at their play.\"\\nThat is true, that is the worst of it. The man, the writer, over whom\\nthe irresistible desire to mock at himself, his work, his puppets and\\ntheir fortunes has power, will never be a novelist. The novelist must\\n\"make believe very much\"; he must be in earnest with his characters. But\\nhow to be in earnest, how to keep the note of disbelief and derision \"out\\nof the memorial\"? Ah, there is the difficulty, but it is a difficulty of\\nwhich many authors appear to be insensible. Perhaps they suffer from no\\nsuch temptations.\\nCHAPTER XV: THE SUPERNATURAL IN FICTION\\nIt is a truism that the supernatural in fiction should, as a general\\nrule, be left in the vague. In the creepiest tale I ever read, the\\nhorror lay in this--_there was no ghost_! You may describe a ghost with\\nall the most hideous features that fancy can suggest--saucer eyes, red\\nstaring hair, a forked tail, and what you please--but the reader only\\nlaughs. It is wiser to make as if you were going to describe the\\nspectre, and then break off, exclaiming, \"But no! No pen can describe,\\nno memory, thank Heaven, can recall, the horror of that hour!\" So\\nwriters, as a rule, prefer to leave their terror (usually styled \"The\\nThing\") entirely in the dark, and to the frightened fancy of the student.\\nThus, on the whole, the treatment of the supernaturally terrible in\\nfiction is achieved in two ways, either by actual description, or by\\nadroit suggestion, the author saying, like cabmen, \"I leave it to\\nyourself, sir.\" There are dangers in both methods; the description, if\\nattempted, is usually overdone and incredible: the suggestion is apt to\\nprepare us too anxiously for something that never becomes real, and to\\nleave us disappointed.\\nExamples of both methods may be selected from poetry and prose. The\\nexamples in verse are rare enough; the first and best that occurs in the\\nway of suggestion is, of course, the mysterious lady in \"Christabel.\"\\n \"She was most beautiful to see,\\n Like a lady of a far countree.\"\\nWho was she? What did she want? Whence did she come? What was the\\nhorror she revealed to the night in the bower of Christabel?\\n \"Then drawing in her breath aloud\\n Like one that shuddered, she unbound\\n The cincture from beneath her breast.\\n Her silken robe and inner vest\\n Dropt to her feet, and full in view\\n Behold her bosom and half her side--\\n A sight to dream of, not to tell!\\n O shield her! shield sweet Christabel!\"\\nAnd then what do her words mean?\\n \"Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow,\\n This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow.\"\\nWhat was it--the \"sight to dream of, not to tell?\"\\nColeridge never did tell, and, though he and Mr. Gilman said he knew,\\nWordsworth thought he did not know. He raised a spirit that he had not\\nthe spell to lay. In the Paradise of Poets has he discovered the secret?\\nWe only know that the mischief, whatever it may have been, was wrought.\\n \"O sorrow and shame! Can this be she--\\n The lady who knelt at the old oak tree?\"\\n . . .\\n \"A star hath set, a star hath risen,\\n O Geraldine, since arms of thine\\n Have been the lovely lady\\'s prison.\\n O Geraldine, one hour was thine.\" {11}\\nIf Coleridge knew, why did he never tell? And yet he maintains that \"in\\nthe very first conception of the tale, I had the whole present to my\\nmind, with the wholeness no less than with the liveliness of a vision,\"\\nand he expected to finish the three remaining parts within the year. The\\nyear was 1816, the poem was begun in 1797, and finished, as far as it\\ngoes, in 1800. If Coleridge ever knew what he meant, he had time to\\nforget. The chances are that his indolence, or his forgetfulness, was\\nthe making of \"Christabel,\" which remains a masterpiece of supernatural\\nsuggestion.\\nFor description it suffices to read the \"Ancient Mariner.\" These\\nmarvels, truly, are _speciosa miracula_, and, unlike Southey, we believe\\nas we read. \"You have selected a passage fertile in unmeaning miracles,\"\\nLamb wrote to Southey (1798), \"but have passed by fifty passages as\\nmiraculous as the miracles they celebrate.\" Lamb appears to have been\\nalmost alone in appreciating this masterpiece of supernatural\\ndescription. Coleridge himself shrank from his own wonders, and wanted\\nto call the piece \"A Poet\\'s Reverie.\" \"It is as bad as Bottom the\\nweaver\\'s declaration that he is not a lion, but only the scenical\\nrepresentation of a lion. What new idea is gained by this title but one\\nsubversive of all credit--which the tale should force upon us--of its\\ntruth?\" Lamb himself was forced, by the temper of the time, to declare\\nthat he \"disliked all the miraculous part of it,\" as if it were not _all_\\nmiraculous! Wordsworth wanted the Mariner \"to have a character and a\\nprofession,\" perhaps would have liked him to be a gardener, or a butler,\\nwith \"an excellent character!\" In fact, the love of the supernatural was\\nthen at so low an ebb that a certain Mr. Marshall \"went to sleep while\\nthe \\'Ancient Mariner\\' was reading,\" and the book was mainly bought by\\nseafaring men, deceived by the title, and supposing that the \"Ancient\\nMariner\" was a nautical treatise.\\nIn verse, then, Coleridge succeeds with the supernatural, both by way of\\ndescription in detail, and of suggestion. If you wish to see a failure,\\ntry the ghost, the moral but not affable ghost, in Wordsworth\\'s\\n\"Laodamia.\" It is blasphemy to ask the question, but is the ghost in\\n\"Hamlet\" quite a success? Do we not see and hear a little too much of\\nhim? Macbeth\\'s airy and viewless dagger is really much more successful\\nby way of suggestion. The stage makes a ghost visible and familiar, and\\nthis is one great danger of the supernatural in art. It is apt to insist\\non being too conspicuous. Did the ghost of Darius, in \"AEschylus,\"\\nfrighten the Athenians? Probably they smiled at the imperial spectre.\\nThere is more discretion in Caesar\\'s ghost--\\n \"I think it is the weakness of mine eyes\\n That shapes this monstrous apparition,\"\\nsays Brutus, and he lays no very great stress on the brief visit of the\\nappearance. For want of this discretion, Alexandre Dumas\\'s ghosts, as in\\n\"The Corsican Brothers,\" are failures. They make themselves too common\\nand too cheap, like the spectre in Mrs. Oliphant\\'s novel, \"The Wizard\\'s\\nSon.\" This, indeed, is the crux of the whole adventure. If you paint\\nyour ghost with too heavy a hand, you raise laughter, not fear. If you\\ntouch him too lightly, you raise unsatisfied curiosity, not fear. It may\\nbe easy to shudder, but it is difficult to teach shuddering.\\nIn prose, a good example of the over vague is Miriam\\'s mysterious\\nvisitor--the shadow of the catacombs--in \"Transformation; or, The Marble\\nFaun.\" Hawthorne should have told us more or less; to be sure his\\ncontemporaries knew what he meant, knew who Miriam and the Spectre were.\\nThe dweller in the catacombs now powerfully excites curiosity, and when\\nthat curiosity is unsatisfied, we feel aggrieved, vexed, and suspect that\\nHawthorne himself was puzzled, and knew no more than his readers. He has\\nnot--as in other tales he has--managed to throw the right atmosphere\\nabout this being. He is vague in the wrong way, whereas George Sand, in\\n_Les Dames Vertes_, is vague in the right way. We are left in _Les Dames\\nVertes_ with that kind of curiosity which persons really engaged in the\\nadventure might have felt, not with the irritation of having a secret\\nkept from us, as in \"Transformation.\"\\nIn \"Wandering Willie\\'s Tale\" (in \"Redgauntlet\"), the right atmosphere is\\nfound, the right note is struck. All is vividly real, and yet, if you\\nclose the book, all melts into a dream again. Scott was almost equally\\nsuccessful with a described horror in \"The Tapestried Chamber.\" The idea\\nis the commonplace of haunted houses, the apparition is described as\\nminutely as a burglar might have been; and yet we do not mock, but\\nshudder as we read. Then, on the other side--the side of\\nanticipation--take the scene outside the closed door of the vanished Dr.\\nJekyll, in Mr. Stevenson\\'s well-known apologue:\\nThey are waiting on the threshold of the chamber whence the doctor has\\ndisappeared--the chamber tenanted by what? A voice comes from the room.\\n\"Sir,\" said Poole, looking Mr. Utterson in the eyes, \"was that my\\nmaster\\'s voice?\"\\nA friend, a man of affairs, and a person never accused of being fanciful,\\ntold me that he read through the book to that point in a lonely Highland\\nchateau, at night, and that he did not think it well to finish the story\\ntill next morning, but rushed to bed. So the passage seems \"well-found\"\\nand successful by dint of suggestion. On the other side, perhaps, only\\nScotsmen brought up in country places, familiar from childhood with the\\nterrors of Cameronian myth, and from childhood apt to haunt the lonely\\nchurchyards, never stirred since the year of the great Plague choked the\\nsoil with the dead, perhaps _they_ only know how much shudder may be\\nfound in Mr. Stevenson\\'s \"Thrawn Janet.\" The black smouldering heat in\\nthe hills and glens that are commonly so fresh, the aspect of the Man,\\nthe Tempter of the Brethren, we know them, and we have enough of the old\\nblood in us to be thrilled by that masterpiece of the described\\nsupernatural. It may be only a local success, it may not much affect the\\nEnglish reader, but it is of sure appeal to the lowland Scot. The\\nancestral Covenanter within us awakens, and is terrified by his ancient\\nfears.\\nPerhaps it may die out in a positive age--this power of learning to\\nshudder. To us it descends from very long ago, from the far-off\\nforefathers who dreaded the dark, and who, half starved and all untaught,\\nsaw spirits everywhere, and scarce discerned waking experience from\\ndreams. When we are all perfect positivist philosophers, when a thousand\\ngenerations of nurses that never heard of ghosts have educated the\\nthousand and first generation of children, then the supernatural may fade\\nout of fiction. But has it not grown and increased since Wordsworth\\nwanted the \"Ancient Mariner\" to have \"a profession and a character,\"\\nsince Southey called that poem a Dutch piece of work, since Lamb had to\\npretend to dislike its \"miracles\"? Why, as science becomes more cock-\\nsure, have men and women become more and more fond of old follies, and\\nmore pleased with the stirring of ancient dread within their veins?\\nAs the visible world is measured, mapped, tested, weighed, we seem to\\nhope more and more that a world of invisible romance may not be far from\\nus, or, at least, we care more and more to follow fancy into these airy\\nregions, _et inania regna_. The supernatural has not ceased to tempt\\nromancers, like Alexandre Dumas, usually to their destruction; more\\nrarely, as in Mrs. Oliphant\\'s \"Beleaguered City,\" to such success as they\\ndo not find in the world of daily occupation. The ordinary shilling\\ntales of \"hypnotism\" and mesmerism are vulgar trash enough, and yet I can\\nbelieve that an impossible romance, if the right man wrote it in the\\nright mood, might still win us from the newspapers, and the stories of\\nshabby love, and cheap remorses, and commonplace failures.\\n \"But it needs Heaven-sent moments for this skill.\"\\nCHAPTER XVI: AN OLD SCOTTISH PSYCHICAL RESEARCHER\\n ADVERTISEMENT\\n \"If any Gentlemen, and others, will be pleased to send me any\\n relations about Spirits, Witches, and Apparitions, In any part of the\\n Kingdom; or any Information about the Second Sight, Charms, Spells,\\n Magic, and the like, They shall oblige the Author, and have them\\n publisht to their satisfaction.\\n \"Direct your Relations to Alexander Ogstouns, Shop Stationer, at the\\n foot of the Plain-stones, at Edinburgh, on the North-side of the\\n Street.\"\\nIs this not a pleasing opportunity for Gentlemen, and Others, whose Aunts\\nhave beheld wraiths, doubles, and fetches? It answers very closely to\\nthe requests of the Society for Psychical Research, who publish, as some\\none disparagingly says, \"the dreams of the middle classes.\" Thanks to\\nFreedom, Progress, and the decline of Superstition, it is now quite safe\\nto see apparitions, and even to publish the narrative of their\\nappearance.\\nBut when Mr. George Sinclair, sometime Professor of Philosophy in\\nGlasgow, issued the invitation which I have copied, at the end of his\\n\"Satan\\'s Invisible World Discovered,\" {12} the vocation of a seer was not\\nso secure from harm. He, or she, might just as probably be burned as\\nnot, on the charge of sorcery, in the year of grace, 1685. However,\\nProfessor Sinclair managed to rake together an odd enough set of legends,\\n\"proving clearly that there are Devils,\" a desirable matter to have\\ncertainty about. \"Satan\\'s Invisible World Discovered\" is a very rare\\nlittle book; I think Scott says in a MS. note that he had great\\ndifficulty in procuring it, when he was at work on his \"infernal\\ndemonology.\" As a copy fell in my way, or rather as I fell in its way, a\\nhelpless victim to its charms and its blue morocco binding, I take this\\nchance of telling again the old tales of 1685.\\nMr. Sinclair began with a long dedicatory Epistle about nothing at all,\\nto the Lord Winton of the period. The Earl dug coal-mines, and\\nconstructed \"a moliminous rampier for a harbour.\" A \"moliminous rampier\"\\nis a choice phrase, and may be envied by novelists who aim at distinction\\nof style. \"Your defending the salt pans against the imperious waves of\\nthe raging sea from the NE. is singular,\" adds the Professor, addressing\\n\"the greatest coal and salt-master in Scotland, who is a nobleman, and\\nthe greatest nobleman who is a Coal and Salt Merchant.\" Perhaps it is\\nalready plain to the modern mind that Mr. George Sinclair, though a\\nProfessor of Philosophy, was not a very sagacious character.\\nMr. Sinclair professes that his proofs of the existence of Devils \"are no\\nold wife\\'s trattles about the fire, but such as may bide the test.\" He\\nlived, one should remember, in an age when faith was really seeking aid\\nfrom ghost stories. Glanvil\\'s books--and, in America, those of Cotton\\nMather--show the hospitality to anecdotes of an edifying sort, which we\\nadmire in Mr. Sinclair. Indeed, Sinclair borrows from Glanvil and Henry\\nMore, authors who, like himself, wished to establish the existence of the\\nsupernatural on the strange incidents which still perplex us, but which\\nare scarcely regarded as safe matter to argue upon. The testimony for a\\nGhost would seldom go to a jury in our days, though amply sufficient in\\nthe time of Mr. Sinclair. About \"The Devil of Glenluce\" he took\\nparticular care to be well informed, and first gave it to the world in a\\nvolume on--you will never guess what subject--Hydrostatics! In the\\npresent work he offers us\\n \"The Devil of Glenluce Enlarged\\n With several Remarkable Additions\\n from an Eye and Ear Witness,\\n A Person of undoubted\\n Honesty.\"\\nMr. Sinclair recommends its \"usefulness for refuting Atheism.\" Probably\\nMr. Sinclair got the story, or had it put off on him rather, through one\\nCampbell, a student of philosophy in Glasgow, the son of Gilbert\\nCampbell, a weaver of Glenluce, in Galloway; the scene in our own time,\\nof a mysterious murder. Campbell had refused alms to Alexander Agnew, a\\nbold and sturdy beggar, who, when asked by the Judge whether he believed\\nin a God, answered: \"He knew no God but Salt, Meal, and Water.\" In\\nconsequence of the refusal of alms, \"The Stirs first began.\" The \"Stirs\"\\nare ghostly disturbances. They commenced with whistling in the house and\\nout of it, \"such as children use to make with their small, slender glass\\nwhistles.\" \"About the Middle of November,\" says Mr. Sinclair, \"the Foul\\nFiend came on with his extraordinary assaults.\" Observe that he takes\\nthe Foul Fiend entirely for granted, and that he never tells us the date\\nof the original quarrel, and the early agitation. Stones were thrown\\ndown the chimney and in at the windows, but nobody was hurt.\\nNaturally Gilbert Campbell carried his tale of sorrow to the parish\\nMinister. This did not avail him. His warp and threads were cut on his\\nloom, and even the clothes of his family were cut while they were wearing\\nthem. At night something tugged the blankets off their beds, a favourite\\nold spiritual trick, which was played, if I remember well, on a Roman\\nEmperor, according to Suetonius. Poor Campbell had to remove his stock-\\nin-trade, and send his children to board out, \"to try whom the trouble\\ndid most follow.\" After this, all was quiet (as perhaps might be\\nexpected), and quiet all remained, till a son named Thomas was brought\\nhome again. Then the house was twice set on fire, and it might have been\\nenough to give Thomas a beating. On the other hand, Campbell sent Thomas\\nto stay with the Minister. But the troubles continued in the old way. At\\nlast the family became so accustomed to the Devil, \"that they were no\\nmore afraid to keep up the Clash\" (chatter) \"with the Foul Fiend than to\\nspeak to each other.\" They were like the Wesleys, who were so familiar\\nwith the fiend Jeffrey, that haunted their home.\\nThe Minister, with a few of the gentry, heard of their unholy friendship,\\nand paid Campbell a visit. \"At their first coming in the Devil says:\\n\\'_Quum Literarum_ is good Latin.\\'\" These are the first words of the\\nLatin rudiments which scholars are taught when they go to the Grammar\\nSchool. Then they all prayed, and a Voice came from under the bed:\\n\"Would you know the Witches of Glenluce?\" The Voice named a few,\\nincluding one long dead. But the Minister, with rare good sense,\\nremarked that what Satan said was not evidence.\\nLet it be remarked that \"the lad Tom\" had that very day \"come back with\\nthe Minister.\" The Fiend then offered terms. \"Give me a spade and\\nshovel, and depart from the house for seven days, and I will make a\\ngrave, and lie down in it, and trouble you no more.\" Hereon Campbell,\\nwith Scottish caution, declined to give the Devil the value of a straw.\\nThe visitors then hunted after the voice, observing that some of the\\nchildren were in bed. They found nothing, and then, as the novelists\\nsay, \"a strange thing happened.\"\\nThere appeared a naked hand and an arm, from the elbow down, beating upon\\nthe floor till the house did shake again. \"The Fiend next exclaimed that\\nif the candle were put out he would appear in the shape of Fireballs.\"\\nLet it be observed that now, for the first time, we learn that all the\\nscene occurred in candle-light. The appearance of floating balls of fire\\nis frequent (if we may believe the current reports) at spiritualistic\\nseances. But what a strange, ill-digested tale is Mr. Sinclair\\'s! He\\nlets slip an expression which shows that the investigators were in one\\nroom, the But, while the Fiend was diverting himself in the other room,\\nthe Ben! The Fiend (nobody going Ben) next chaffed a gentleman who wore\\na fashionable broad-brimmed hat, \"whereupon he presently imagined that he\\nfelt a pair of shears going about his hat,\" but there was no such matter.\\nThe voice asked for a piece of bread, which the others were eating, and\\nsaid the maid gave him a crust in the morning. This she denied, but\\nadmitted that something had \"clicked\" a piece of bread out of her hand.\\nThe seance ended, the Devil slapping a safe portion of the children\\'s\\nbodies, with a sound resembling applause. After many months of this\\nreally annoying conduct, poor Campbell laid his case before the\\nPresbyters, in 1655, thirty years before the date of publication. So a\\n\"solemn humiliation\" was actually held all through the bounds of the\\nsynod. But to little purpose did Glenluce sit in sackcloth and ashes.\\nThe good wife\\'s plate was snatched away before her very eyes, and then\\nthrown back at her. In similar \"stirs,\" described by a Catholic\\nmissionary in Peru soon after Pizarro\\'s conquest, the cup of an Indian\\nchief was lifted up by an invisible hand, and set down empty. In that\\ncase, too, stones were thrown, as by the Devil of Glenluce.\\nAnd what was the end of it all? Mr. Sinclair has not even taken the\\ntrouble to inquire. It seems by some conjuration or other, the Devil\\nsuffered himself to be put away, and gave the weaver a habitation. The\\nweaver \"has been a very Odd man that endured so long these marvellous\\ndisturbances.\"\\nThis is the tale which Mr. Sinclair offers, without mentioning his\\nauthority. He complains that Dr. Henry More had plagiarised it, from his\\nbook of Hydrostatics. Two points may be remarked. First: modern\\nPsychical Inquirers are more particular about evidence than Mr. Sinclair.\\nNot for nothing do we live in an age of science. Next: the stories of\\nthese \"stirs\" are always much the same everywhere, in Glenluce, at\\nTedworth, where the Drummer came, in Peru, in Wesley\\'s house, in heroic\\nIceland, when Glam, the vampire, \"rode the roofs.\" It is curious to\\nspeculate on how the tradition of making themselves little nuisances in\\nthis particular manner has been handed down among children, if we are to\\nsuppose that children do the trick. Last autumn a farmer\\'s house in\\nScotland was annoyed exactly as the weaver\\'s home was, and that within a\\nquarter of a mile of a well-known man of science. The mattress of the\\nfather was tenanted by something that wriggled like a snake. The\\nmattress was opened, nothing was found, and the disturbance began again\\nas soon as the bed was restored to its place. This occurred when the\\nfarmer\\'s children had been sent to a distance.\\nOne cannot but be perplexed by the problem which these tales suggest.\\nAlmost bare of evidence as they are, their great number, their wide\\ndiffusion, in many countries and in times ancient and modern, may\\nestablish some substratum of truth. Scott mentions a case in which the\\nimposture was detected by a sheriff\\'s officer. But a recent anecdote\\nmakes me almost distrust the detection.\\nSome English people, having taken a country house in Ireland, were vexed\\nby the usual rappings, stone-throwings, and all the rest of the business.\\nThey sent to Dublin for two detectives, who arrived. On their first\\nnight, the lady of the house went into a room, where she found one of the\\npolicemen asleep in his chair. Being a lively person, she rapped twice\\nor thrice on the table. He awakened, and said: \"Ah, so I suspected. It\\nwas hardly worth while, madam, to bring us so far for this.\" And next\\nday the worthy men withdrew in dudgeon, but quite convinced that they had\\ndiscovered the agent in the hauntings.\\nBut they had not!\\nOn the other hand, Scott (who had seen one ghost, if not two, and had\\nheard a \"warning\") states that Miss Anne Robinson managed the Stockwell\\ndisturbances by tying horsehairs to plates and light articles, which then\\ndemeaned themselves as if possessed.\\nHere we have _vera causa_, a demonstrable cause of \"stirs,\" and it may be\\ninferred that all the other historical occurrences had a similar origin.\\nWe have, then, only to be interested in the persistent tradition, in\\naccordance with which mischievous persons always do exactly the same sort\\nof thing. But this is a mere example of the identity of human nature.\\nIt is curious to see how Mr. Sinclair plumes himself on this Devil of\\nGlenluce as a \"moliminous rampier\" against irreligion. \"This one\\nRelation is worth all the price that can be given for the Book.\" The\\nprice I have given for the volume is Ten Golden Guineas, and perhaps the\\nFoul Thief of Glenluce is hardly worth the money.\\n\"I believe if the Obdurest Atheist among men would seriously and in good\\nearnest consider that relation, and ponder all the circumstances thereof,\\nhe would presently cry out, as a Dr. of Physick did, hearing a story less\\nconsiderable, \\'I believe I have been in the wrong all the time--if this\\nbe true.\\'\"\\nMr. Sinclair is also a believer in the Woodstock devils, on which Scott\\nfounded his novel. He does not give the explanation that Giles Sharp,\\nalias Joseph Collins of Oxford, alias Funny Joe, was all the Devil in\\nthat affair. Scott had read the story of Funny Joe, but could never\\nremember \"whether it exists in a separate collection, or where it is to\\nbe looked for.\"\\nIndifferent to evidence, Mr. Sinclair confutes the Obdurest Atheists with\\nthe Pied Piper of Hamelin, with the young lady from Howells\\' \"Letters,\"\\nwhose house, like Rahab\\'s, was \"on the city wall,\" and with the ghost of\\nthe Major who appeared to the Captain (as he had promised), and scolded\\nhim for not keeping his sword clean. He also gives us Major Weir, at\\nfull length, convincing us that, as William Erskine said, \"The Major was\\na disgusting fellow, a most ungentlemanlike character.\" Scott, on the\\nother hand, remarked, long before \"Waverley,\" \"if I ever were to become a\\nwriter of prose romances, I think I would choose Major Weir, if not for\\nmy hero, at least for an agent and a leading one, in my production.\" He\\nadmitted that the street where the Major lived was haunted by a woman\\n\"twice the common length,\" \"but why should we set him down for an\\nungentlemanly fellow?\" Readers of Mr. Sinclair will understand the\\nreason very well, and it is not necessary, nor here even possible, to\\njustify Erskine\\'s opinion by quotations. Suffice it that, by virtue of\\nhis enchanted staff, which was burned with him, the Major was enabled \"to\\ncommit evil not to be named, yea, even to reconcile man and wife when at\\nvariance.\" His sister, who was hanged, had Redgauntlet\\'s horse-shoe mark\\non her brow, and one may marvel that Scott does not seem to have\\nremembered this coincidence. \"There was seen an exact Horse-shoe, shaped\\nfor nails, in her wrinkles. Terrible enough, I assure you, to the\\nstoutest beholder!\"\\nMost modern readers will believe that both the luckless Major and his\\nsister were religious maniacs. Poverty, solitude, and the superstition\\nof their time were the true demon of Major Weir, burned at the stake in\\nApril 1670. Perhaps the most singular impression made by \"Satan\\'s\\nInvisible World Discovered\" is that in Sinclair\\'s day, people who did not\\nbelieve in bogies believed in nothing, while people who shared the common\\ncreed of Christendom were capable of believing in everything.\\nAtheists are as common as ghosts in his marvellous relations, and the\\nvery wizards themselves were often Atheists.\\nNOTE.--I have said that Scott himself had seen one ghost, if not two, and\\nheard a \"warning.\" The ghost was seen near Ashestiel, on an open spot of\\nhillside, \"please to observe it was before dinner.\" The anecdote is in\\nGillis\\'s, \"Recollections of Sir Walter Scott,\" p. 170. The vision of\\nLord Byron standing in the great hall of Abbotsford is described in the\\n\"Demonology and Witchcraft .\" Scott alleges that it resolved itself into\\n\"great coats, shawls, and plaids\"--a hallucination. But Lockhart remarks\\n(\"Life,\" ix. p. 141) that he did not care to have the circumstance\\ndiscussed in general. The \"stirs\" in Abbotsford during the night when\\nhis architect, Bullock, died in London, are in Lockhart, v. pp. 309-315.\\n\"The noise resembled half-a-dozen men hard at work putting up boards and\\nfurniture, and nothing can be more certain than that there was nobody on\\nthe premises at the time.\" The noise, unluckily, occurred twice, April\\n28 and 29, 1818, and Lockhart does not tell us on which of these two\\nnights Mr. Bullock died. Such is the casualness of ghost story-tellers.\\nLockhart adds that the coincidence made a strong impression on Sir\\nWalter\\'s mind. He did not care to ascertain the point in his own mental\\nconstitution \"where incredulity began to waver,\" according to his friend,\\nMr. J. L. Adolphus.\\nCHAPTER XVII: THE BOY\\nAs a humble student of savage life, I have found it necessary to make\\nresearches into the manners and customs of boys. Boys are not what a\\nvain people supposes. If you meet them in the holidays, you find them\\naffable and full of kindness and good qualities. They will condescend to\\nyour weakness at lawn-tennis, they will aid you in your selection of fly-\\nhooks, and, to be brief, will behave with much more than the civility of\\ntame Zulus or Red Men on a missionary settlement. But boys at school and\\namong themselves, left to the wild justice and traditional laws which\\nmany generations of boys have evolved, are entirely different beings.\\nThey resemble that Polynesian prince who had rejected the errors of\\npolytheism for those of an extreme sect of Primitive Seceders. For weeks\\nat a time this prince was known to be \"steady,\" but every month or so he\\ndisappeared, and his subjects said he was \"lying off.\" To adopt an\\nAmerican idiom, he \"felt like brandy and water\"; he also \"felt like\"\\nwearing no clothes, and generally rejecting his new conceptions of duty\\nand decency. In fact, he had a good bout of savagery, and then he\\nreturned to his tall hat, his varnished boots, his hymn-book, and his\\nedifying principles. The life of small boys at school (before they get\\ninto long-tailed coats and the upper-fifth) is often a mere course of\\n\"lying-off\"--of relapse into native savagery with its laws and customs.\\nIf any one has so far forgotten his own boyhood as to think this\\ndescription exaggerated, let him just fancy what our comfortable\\ncivilised life would be, if we could become boys in character and custom.\\nLet us suppose that you are elected to a new club, of which most of the\\nmembers are strangers to you. You enter the doors for the first time,\\nwhen two older members, who have been gossiping in the hall, pounce upon\\nyou with the exclamation, \"Hullo, here\\'s a new fellow! You fellow,\\nwhat\\'s your name?\" You reply, let us say, \"Johnson.\" \"I don\\'t believe\\nit, it\\'s such a rum name. What\\'s your father?\" Perhaps you are\\nconstrained to answer \"a Duke\" or (more probably) \"a solicitor.\" In the\\nformer case your friends bound up into the smoking-room, howling, \"Here\\'s\\na new fellow says his father is a Duke. Let\\'s take the cheek out of\\nhim.\" And they \"take it out\" with umbrellas, slippers, and other\\nsurgical instruments. Or, in the latter case (your parent being a\\nsolicitor) they reply, \"Then your father must be a beastly cad. All\\nsolicitors are sharks. _My_ father says so, and he knows. How many\\nsisters have you?\" The new member answers, \"Four.\" \"Any of them\\nmarried?\" \"No.\" \"How awfully awkward for you.\"\\nBy this time, perhaps, luncheon is ready, or the evening papers come in,\\nand you are released for a moment. You sneak up into the library, where\\nyou naturally expect to be entirely alone, and you settle on a sofa with\\na novel. But an old member bursts into the room, spies a new fellow, and\\nputs him through the usual catechism. He ends with, \"How much tin have\\nyou got?\" You answer \"twenty pounds,\" or whatever the sum may be, for\\nperhaps you had contemplated playing whist. \"Very well, fork it out; you\\nmust give a dinner, all new fellows must, and _you_ are not going to\\nbegin by being a stingy beast?\" Thus addressed, as your friend is a big\\nbald man, who looks mischievous, you do \"fork out\" all your ready money,\\nand your new friend goes off to consult the cook. Meanwhile you \"shed a\\nblooming tear,\" as Homer says, and go home heart-broken. Now, does any\\ngrown-up man call this state of society civilisation? Would life be\\nworth living (whatever one\\'s religious consolations) on these terms? Of\\ncourse not, and yet this picture is a not overdrawn sketch of the career\\nof some new boy, at some schools new or old. The existence of a small\\nschoolboy is, in other respects, not unlike that of an outsider in a\\nlawless \"Brotherhood,\" as the Irish playfully call their murder clubs.\\nThe small boy is _in_ the society, but not _of_ it, as far as any\\nbenefits go. He has to field out (and I admit that the discipline is\\nsalutary) while other boys bat. Other boys commit the faults, and compel\\nhim to copy out the impositions--say five hundred lines of Virgil--with\\nwhich their sins are visited. Other boys enjoy the pleasures of\\nfootball, while the small boy has to run vaguely about, never within five\\nyards of the ball. Big boys reap the glories of paperchases, the small\\nboy gets lost in the bitter weather, on the open moors, or perhaps (as in\\none historical case) is frozen to death within a measurable distance of\\nthe school playground. And the worst of it is that, as a member of the\\ngreat school secret society, the small boy can never complain of his\\nwrongs, or divulge the name of his tormentors. It is in this respect\\nthat he resembles a harmless fellow, dragged into the coils of an\\nAnarchist \"Inner Brotherhood.\" He is exposed to all sorts of wrongs from\\nhis neighbours, and he can only escape by turning \"informer,\" by breaking\\nthe most sacred law of his society, losing all social status, and,\\nprobably, obliging his parents to remove him from school. Life at\\nschool, as among the Celtic peoples, turns on the belief that law and\\nauthority are natural enemies, against which every one is banded.\\nThe chapter of bullying among boys is one on which a man enters with\\nreluctance. Boys are, on the whole, such good fellows, and so full of\\nfine unsophisticated qualities, that the mature mind would gladly turn\\naway its eyes from beholding their iniquities. Even a cruel bully does\\nnot inevitably and invariably develop into a bad man. He is, let us\\nhope, only passing through the savage stage, in which the torture of\\nprisoners is a recognised institution. He has, perhaps, too little\\nimagination to understand the pain he causes. Very often bullying is not\\nphysically cruel, but only a perverted sort of humour, such as Kingsley,\\nin \"Hypatia,\" recognised among his favourite Goths. I remember a feeble\\nfoolish boy at school (feeble he certainly was, and was thought foolish)\\nwho became the subject of much humorous bullying. His companions used to\\ntie a thin thread round his ear, and attach this to a bar at such a\\nheight that he could only avoid breaking it by standing on tiptoe. But\\nhe was told that he must not break the thread. To avoid infringing this\\ncommandment, he put himself to considerable inconvenience and afforded\\nmuch enjoyment to the spectators.\\nMen of middle age, rather early middle age, remember the two following\\nspecies of bullying to which they were subjected, and which, perhaps, are\\nobsolescent. Tall stools were piled up in a pyramid, and the victim was\\nseated on the top, near the roof of the room. The other savages brought\\nhim down from this bad eminence by hurling other stools at those which\\nsupported him. Or the victim was made to place his hands against the\\ndoor, with the fingers outstretched, while the young tormentors played at\\nthe Chinese knife-trick. They threw knives, that is to say, at the door\\nbetween the apertures of the fingers, and, as a rule, they hit the\\nfingers and not the door. These diversions I know to be correctly\\nreported, but the following pretty story is, perhaps, a myth. At one of\\nthe most famous public schools, a praepostor, or monitor, or sixth-form\\nboy having authority, heard a pistol-shot in the room above his own. He\\nwent up and found a big boy and a little boy. They denied having any\\npistol. The monitor returned to his studies, again was sure he heard a\\nshot, went up, and found the little boy dead. The big boy had been\\nplaying the William Tell trick with him, and had hit his head instead of\\nthe apple. That is the legend. Whether it be true or false, all boys\\nwill agree that the little victim could not have escaped by complaining\\nto the monitor. No. Death before dishonour. But the side not so seamy\\nof this picture of school life is the extraordinary power of honour among\\nboys. Of course the laws of the secret society might well terrify a\\npuerile informer. But the sentiment of honour is even more strong than\\nfear, and will probably outlast the very disagreeable circumstances in\\nwhich it was developed.\\nPeople say bullying is not what it used to be. The much abused\\nmonitorial system has this in it of good, that it enables a clever and\\nkindly boy who is high up in the school to stop the cruelties (if he\\nhears of them) of a much bigger boy who is low in the school. But he\\nseldom hears of them. Habitual bullies are very cunning, and I am\\nacquainted with instances in which they carry their victims off to lonely\\ntorture cells (so to speak) and deserted places fit for the sport. Some\\nyears ago a small boy, after a long course of rope\\'s-ending in out-of-the-\\nway dens, revealed the abominations of some naval cadets. There was not\\nmuch sympathy with him in the public mind, and perhaps his case was not\\nwell managed. But it was made clear that whereas among men an unpopular\\nperson is only spoken evil of behind his back, an unpopular small boy\\namong boys is made to suffer in a more direct and very unpleasant way.\\nMost of us leave school with the impression that there was a good deal of\\nbullying when we were little, but that the institution has died out. The\\ntruth is that we have grown too big to be bullied, and too good-natured\\nto bully ourselves. When I left school, I thought bullying was an\\nextinct art, like encaustic painting (before it was rediscovered by Sir\\nWilliam Richmond). But a distinguished writer, who was a small boy when\\nI was a big one, has since revealed to me the most abominable cruelties\\nwhich were being practised at the very moment when I supposed bullying to\\nhave had its day and ceased to be. Now, the small boy need only have\\nmentioned the circumstances to any one of a score of big boys, and the\\ntormentor would have been first thrashed, and then, probably, expelled.\\nA friend of my own was travelling lately in a wild and hilly region on\\nthe other side of the world, let us say in the Mountains of the Moon. In\\na mountain tavern he had thrust upon him the society of the cook, a very\\nuseless young man, who astonished him by references to one of our\\nuniversities, and to the enjoyments of that seat of learning. This youth\\n(who was made cook, and a very bad cook too, because he could do nothing\\nelse) had been expelled from a large English school. And he was expelled\\nbecause he had felled a bully with a paving-stone, and had expressed his\\nreadiness to do it again. Now, there was no doubt that this cook in the\\nmountain inn was a very unserviceable young fellow. But I wish more boys\\nwho have suffered things literally unspeakable from bullies would try\\nwhether force (in the form of a paving stone) is really no remedy.\\nThe Catholic author of a recent book (\"Schools,\" by Lieut.-Col. Raleigh\\nChichester), is very hard on \"Protestant Schools,\" and thinks that the\\nCatholic system of constant watching is a remedy for bullying and other\\nevils. \"Swing-doors with their upper half glazed, might have their\\nuses,\" he says, and he does not see why a boy should not be permitted to\\ncomplain, if he is roasted, like Tom Brown, before a large fire. The\\nboys at one Catholic school described by Colonel Raleigh Chichester, \"are\\nnever without surveillance of some sort.\" This is true of most French\\nschools, and any one who wishes to understand the consequences (there)\\nmay read the published confessions of a _pion_--an usher, or \"spy.\" A\\nmore degraded and degrading life than that of the wretched _pion_, it is\\nimpossible to imagine. In an English private school, the system of\\n_espionnage_ and tale bearing, when it exists, is probably not unlike\\nwhat Mr. Anstey describes in _Vice Versa_. But in the Catholic schools\\nspoken of by Colonel Raleigh Chichester, the surveillance may be, as he\\nsays, \"that of a parent; an aid to the boys in their games rather than a\\ncheck.\" The religious question as between Catholics and Protestants has\\nno essential connection with the subject. A Protestant school might, and\\nGrimstone\\'s did, have tale-bearers; possibly a Catholic school might\\nexist without parental surveillance. That system is called by its foes a\\n\"police,\" by its friends a \"paternal\" system. But fathers don\\'t exercise\\nthe \"paternal\" system themselves in this country, and we may take it for\\ngranted that, while English society and religion are as they are,\\nsurveillance at our large schools will be impossible. If any one regrets\\nthis, let him read the descriptions of French schools and schooldays, in\\nBalzac\\'s _Louis Lambert_, in the \"Memoirs\" of M. Maxime du Camp, in any\\nbook where a Frenchman speaks his mind about his youth. He will find\\nspying (of course) among the ushers, contempt and hatred on the side of\\nthe boys, unwholesome and cruel punishments, a total lack of healthy\\nexercise; and he will hear of holidays spent in premature excursions into\\nforbidden and shady quarters of the town.\\nNo doubt the best security against bullying is in constant occupation.\\nThere can hardly (in spite of Master George Osborne\\'s experience in\\n\"Vanity Fair\") be much bullying in an open cricket-field. Big boys, too,\\nwith good hearts, should not only stop bullying when they come across it,\\nbut make it their business to find out where it exists. Exist it will,\\nmore or less, despite all precautions, while boys are boys--that is, are\\npassing through a modified form of the savage state.\\nThere is a curious fact in the boyish character which seems, at first\\nsight, to make good the opinion that private education, at home, is the\\ntrue method. Before they go out into school life, many little fellows of\\nnine, or so, are extremely original, imaginative, and almost poetical.\\nThey are fond of books, fond of nature, and, if you can win their\\nconfidence, will tell you all sorts of pretty thoughts and fancies which\\nlie about them in their infancy. I have known a little boy who liked to\\nlie on the grass and to people the alleys and glades of that miniature\\nforest with fairies and dwarfs, whom he seemed actually to see in a kind\\nof vision. But he went to school, he instantly won the hundred yards\\nrace for boys under twelve, and he came back a young barbarian,\\ninterested in \"the theory of touch\" (at football), curious in the art of\\nbowling, and no more capable than you or I of seeing fairies in a green\\nmeadow. He was caught up into the air of the boy\\'s world, and his\\nimagination was in abeyance for a season.\\nThis is a common enough thing, and rather a melancholy spectacle to\\nbehold. One is tempted to believe that school causes the loss of a good\\ndeal of genius, and that the small boys who leave home poets, and come\\nback barbarians, have been wasted. But, on the other hand, if they had\\nbeen kept at home and encouraged, the chances are that they would have\\nblossomed into infant phenomena and nothing better. The awful infancy of\\nMr. John Stuart Mill is a standing warning. Mr. Mill would probably have\\nbeen a much happier and wiser man if he had not been a precocious\\nlinguist, economist, and philosopher, but had passed through a healthy\\nstage of indifference to learning and speculation at a public school.\\nLook again, at the childhood of Bishop Thirlwall. His _Primitiae_ were\\npublished (by Samuel Tipper, London, 1808), when young Connop was but\\neleven years of age. His indiscreet father \"launched this slender bark,\"\\nas he says, and it sailed through three editions between 1808 and 1809.\\nYoung Thirlwall was taught Latin at three years of age, \"and at four read\\nGreek with an ease and fluency which astonished all who heard him.\" At\\nseven he composed an essay, \"On the Uncertainty of Human Life,\" but \"his\\ntaste for poetry was not discovered till a later period.\" His sermons,\\nsome forty, occupy most of the little volume in which these _Primitiae_\\nwere collected.\\nHe was especially concerned about Sabbath desecration. \"I confess,\"\\nobserves this sage of ten, \"when I look upon the present and past state\\nof our public morals, and when I contrast our present luxury,\\ndissipation, and depravity, with past frugality and virtue, I feel not\\nmerely a sensation of regret, but also of terror, for the result of the\\nchange.\" \"The late Revolution in France,\" he adds, \"has afforded us a\\nremarkable lesson how necessary religion is to a State, and that from a\\ndeficiency on that head arise the chief evils which can befall society.\"\\nHe then bids us \"remember that the Nebuchadnezzar who may destroy our\\nIsrael is near at hand,\" though it might be difficult to show how\\nNebuchadnezzar destroyed Israel.\\nAs to the uncertainty of life, he remarks that \"Edward VI. died in his\\nminority, and disappointed his subjects, to whom he had promised a happy\\nreign.\" Of this infant\\'s thirty-nine sermons (just as many as the\\nArticles), it may be said that they are in no way inferior to other\\nexamples of this class of literature. But sermons are among the least\\n\"scarce\" and \"rare\" of human essays, and many parents would rather see\\ntheir boy patiently acquiring the art of wicket-keeping at school than\\nmoralising on the uncertainty of life at home. Some one \"having\\npresented to the young author a copy of verses on the trite and familiar\\nsubject of the Ploughboy,\" he replied with an ode on \"The Potboy.\"\\n \"Bliss is not always join\\'d to wealth,\\n Nor dwells beneath the gilded roof\\n For poverty is bliss with health,\\n Of that my potboy stands a proof.\"\\nThe volume ends with this determination,\\n \"Still shall I seek Apollo\\'s shelt\\'ring ray,\\n To cheer my spirits and inspire my lay.\"\\nIf any parent or guardian desires any further information about _Les\\nEnfans devenus celebres par leurs ecrits_, he will find it in a work of\\nthat name, published in Paris in 1688. The learned Scioppius published\\nworks at sixteen, \"which deserved\" (and perhaps obtained) \"the admiration\\nof dotards.\" M. Du Maurier asserts that, at the age of fifteen, Grotius\\npleaded causes at the Bar. At eleven Meursius made orations and\\nharangues which were much admired. At fifteen, Alexandre le Jeune wrote\\nanacreontic verses, and (less excusably) a commentary on the Institutions\\nof Gaius. Grevin published a tragedy and two comedies at the age of\\nthirteen, and at fifteen Louis Stella was a professor of Greek. But no\\none reads Grevin now, nor Stella, nor Alexandre le Jeune, and perhaps\\ntheir time might have been better occupied in being \"soaring human boys\"\\nthan in composing tragedies and commentaries. Monsieur le Duc de Maine\\npublished, in 1678, his _OEuvres d\\'un Auteur de Sept Ans_, a royal\\nexample to be avoided by all boys. These and several score of other\\nexamples may perhaps reconcile us to the spectacle of puerile genius\\nfading away in the existence of the common British schoolboy, who is\\nnothing of a poet, and still less of a jurisconsult.\\nThe British authors who understand boys best are not those who have\\nwritten books exclusively about boys. There is Canon Farrar, for\\nexample, whose romances of boyish life appear to be very popular, but\\nwhose boys, somehow, are not real boys. They are too good when they are\\ngood, and when they are bad, they are not perhaps too bad (that is\\nimpossible), but they are bad in the wrong way. They are bad with a\\nmannish and conscious vice, whereas even bad boys seem to sin less\\nconsciously and after a ferocious fashion of their own. Of the boys in\\n\"Tom Brown\" it is difficult to speak, because the Rugby boy under Arnold\\nseems to have been of a peculiar species. A contemporary pupil was\\nasked, when an undergraduate, what he conceived to be the peculiar\\ncharacteristic of Rugby boys. He said, after mature reflection, that\\n\"the _differentia_ of the Rugby boy was his moral thoughtfulness.\" Now\\nthe characteristic of the ordinary boy is his want of what is called\\nmoral thoughtfulness.\\nHe lives in simple obedience to school traditions. These may compel him,\\nat one school, to speak in a peculiar language, and to persecute and beat\\nall boys who are slow at learning this language. At another school he\\nmay regard dislike of the manly game of football as the sin with which\\n\"heaven heads the count of crimes.\" On the whole this notion seems a\\nuseful protest against the prematurely artistic beings who fill their\\nstudies with photographs of Greek fragments, vases, etchings by the\\nnewest etcher, bits of China, Oriental rugs, and very curious old brass\\ncandlesticks. The \"challenge cup\" soon passes away from the keeping of\\nany house in a public school where Bunthorne is a popular and imitated\\ncharacter. But when we reach aesthetic boys, we pass out of the savage\\nstage into hobbledehoyhood. The bigger boys at public schools are often\\nterribly \"advanced,\" and when they are not at work or play, they are\\nvexing themselves with the riddle of the earth, evolution, agnosticism,\\nand all that kind of thing. Latin verses may not be what conservatives\\nfondly deem them, and even cricket may, it is said, become too absorbing\\na pursuit, but either or both are better than precocious freethinking and\\nsacrifice on the altar of the Beautiful.\\nA big boy who is tackling Haeckel or composing _virelais_ in playtime is\\ndoing himself no good, and is worse than useless to the society of which\\nhe is a member. The small boys, who are the most ardent of\\nhero-worshippers, either despise him or they allow him to address them in\\n_chansons royaux_, and respond with trebles in _triolets_. At present a\\ngreat many boys leave school, pass three years or four at the\\nuniversities, and go back as masters to the place where some of their old\\nschoolfellows are still pupils. It is through these very young masters,\\nperhaps, that \"advanced\" speculations and tastes get into schools, where,\\nhowever excellent in themselves, they are rather out of place. Indeed,\\nthe very young master, though usually earnest in his work, must be a sage\\nindeed if he can avoid talking to the elder boys about the problems that\\ninterest him, and so forcing their minds into precocious attitudes. The\\nadvantage of Eton boys used to be, perhaps is still, that they came up to\\ncollege absolutely destitute of \"ideas,\" and guiltless of reading\\nanything more modern than Virgil. Thus their intellects were quite\\nfallow, and they made astonishing progress when they bent their fresh and\\nunwearied minds to study. But too many boys now leave school with\\nsettled opinions derived from the very latest thing out, from the newest\\nGerman pessimist or American socialist. It may, however, be argued that\\nideas of these sorts are like measles, and that it is better to take them\\nearly and be done with them for ever.\\nWhile schools are reformed and Latin grammars of the utmost ingenuity and\\ndifficulty are published, boys on the whole change very little. They\\nremain the beings whom Thackeray understood better than any other writer:\\nThackeray, who liked boys so much and was so little blind to their\\ndefects. I think he exaggerates their habit of lying to masters, or, if\\nthey lied in his day, their character has altered in that respect, and\\nthey are more truthful than many men find it expedient to be. And they\\nhave given up fighting; the old battles between Berry and Biggs, or\\nDobbin and Cuff (major) are things of the glorious past. Big boys don\\'t\\nfight, and there is a whisper that little boys kick each other\\'s shins\\nwhen in wrath. That practice can hardly be called an improvement, even\\nif we do not care for fisticuffs. Perhaps the gloves are the best\\npeacemakers at school. When all the boys, by practice in boxing, know\\npretty well whom they can in a friendly way lick, they are less tempted\\nto more crucial experiments \"without the gloves.\"\\nBut even the ascertainment of one\\'s relative merits with the gloves hurts\\na good deal, and one may thank heaven that the fountain of youth (as\\ndescribed by Pontus de Tyarde) is not a common beverage. By drinking\\nthis liquid, says the old Frenchman, one is insensibly brought back from\\nold to middle age, and to youth and boyhood. But one would prefer to\\nstop drinking of the fountain before actually being reduced to boy\\'s\\nestate, and passing once more through the tumultuous experiences of that\\nperiod. And of these, _not having enough to eat_ is by no means the\\nleast common. The evidence as to execrable dinners is rather\\ndispiriting, and one may end by saying that if there is a worse fellow\\nthan a bully, it is a master who does not see that his boys are supplied\\nwith plenty of wholesome food. He, at least, could not venture, like a\\ndistinguished headmaster, to preach and publish sermons on \"Boys\\' Life:\\nits Fulness.\" A schoolmaster who has boarders is a hotel-keeper, and\\nthereby makes his income, but he need not keep a hotel which would be\\ndispraised in guide books. Dinners are a branch of school economy which\\nshould not be left to the wives of schoolmasters. _They_ have never been\\nboys.\\nFOOTNOTES\\n{1} \"Mauth\" is Manx for dog, I am told.\\n{2} It is easy to bear the misfortunes of others.\\n{3} In the third volume of his essays.\\n{4} \"I remember I went into the room where my father\\'s body lay, and my\\nmother sat weeping alone by it.
